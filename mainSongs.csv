More productive<br/>
Comfortable<br/>
Not drinking too much<br/>
Regular exercise at the gym, three days a week<br/>
Getting on better with your associate employee contemporaries<br/>
At ease<br/>
Eating well, no more microwave dinners and saturated fats<br/>
A patient, better driver<br/>
A safer car, baby smiling in back seat<br/>
Sleeping well, no bad dreams<br/>
No paranoia<br/>
Careful to all animals, never washing spiders down the plughole<br/>
Keep in contact with old friends, enjoy a drink now and then<br/>
Will frequently check credit at moral bank, hole in wall<br/>
Favours for favours, fond but not in love<br/>
Charity standing orders on sundays, ring-road supermarket<br/>
No killing moths or putting boiling water on the ants<br/>
Car wash, also on sundays<br/>
No longer afraid of the dark or midday shadows, nothing so ridiculously teenage and desperate<br/>
Nothing so childish<br/>
At a better pace, slower and more calculated<br/>
No chance of escape<br/>
Now self-employed<br/>
Concerned, but powerless<br/>
An empowered and informed member of societ, pragmatism not idealism<br/>
Will not cry in public<br/>
Less chance of illness<br/>
Tires that grip in the wet, shot of baby strapped in backseat<br/>
A good memory<br/>
Still cries at a good film<br/>
Still kisses with saliva<br/>
No longer empty and frantic<br/>
Like a cat<br/>
Tied to a stick<br/>
That's driven into<br/>
Frozen winter shit, the ability to laugh at weakness<br/>
Calm, fitter, healthier and more productive<br/>

Toilet trained and dumb<br/>

Batter up<br/>

Turned around and drove the opposite direction 'cause I fear them<br/>
Now when will they come?<br/>

You were all I see<br/>
You were everything<br/>
Cast about you, turning up your gravity and pull me in<br/>
Or under<br/>

Lose whoever you once were<br/>
Died and returned to the earth<br/>
Found ourselves back<br/>
In love<br/>

The road is washed out from the river that flooded just north of town<br/>
We stick stick stick stick to the plan we laid out but we know their saying<br/>
The best best best best plans where both mice and men can go terribly wrong<br/>
And probably will, so please<br/>
Nobody speaks, nobody get any smart ideas<br/>
If we don’t have any heroics we may just get out of here<br/>
And home to your families by dinner time safely and soundly sleeping<br/>
Cause we don’t want trouble, we’ll take what we came for and we’ll leave quiet<br/>
Or maybe we will tear you up, take what you love, and burn it down, and burn it down<br/>
<br/>
Nobody moves, nobody moves and no one gets hurt<br/>
Nobody opens their mouth and we have nothing to worry about<br/>
We’ll keep keep keep keep you alive cause we always need bargaining chips<br/>
(For their lives, we will trade; thee will make your getaway)<br/>
We’ll keep keep keep keep you alive cause you’re pretty<br/>
And we need something to look at while we tear you up, take what you love<br/>
And burn it down, and burn it down<br/>
You swear to build, we swear to come and burn it down<br/>

Weighing the cost of the love you make<br/>
Make you again, yeah<br/>
Feeling the weight of the bones you break<br/>
Break them again, yeah<br/>
<br/>
Weighing the heart (let ‘em wait)<br/>
Sinking our teeth into (let ‘em lie)<br/>
Her wants of life (here we are)<br/>
In magazines (tonight)<br/>
<br/>
Break all the locks without the combination<br/>
I know where you’re headed, I consider it mine<br/>
Went to the crowns without a planning or feeling<br/>
And keep me alert until the next valentine<br/>
<br/>
Please cut me out, cut me out<br/>
Plot and make me the lover you wanted<br/>
When you were young and asleep<br/>
And I’m fine when you, you burn my core from a bottle<br/>
The lover you wanted while you waited so long<br/>

Digging my own grave <br/>
though it's shallow <br/>

Work down in the basement <br/>

and the message is sent <br/>
Always dragging your feet on the sand and the hot cement <br/>

You either push or pull <br/>

When it's the genie at the bottom who I'm sucking at, <br/>
he owes me one last wish <br/>
So here's a present to let you know I still exist <br/>
I hope the next boy that you kiss has something terribly contagious on his lips <br/>
<br/>
But I got a plan (I got a plan) <br/>
To drink for forty days and forty nights <br/>
A sip for every second-hand tick <br/>
And every time you fed the line, <br/>
“you mean so much to me” <br/>
I'm without you <br/>
<br/>
Tell all the English boys you meet <br/>
about the American boy back in the states <br/>
The American boy you used to date <br/>
who would do anything you say <br/>
Tell all the English boys you meet <br/>
about the American boy back in the states <br/>
The American boy you used to date <br/>
who would do anything you say <br/>
<br/>
And even if her plane crashes tonight <br/>
she'll find some way to disappoint me, <br/>
by not burning in the wreckage, <br/>
or drowning at the bottom of the sea <br/>
Jess, I still taste you, and thus reserve my right to hate you <br/>
And all this empty space that you create <br/>
does nothing for my flawless sense of style <br/>
It's 8:45(it's 8:45), the weather is getting better by the hour(rains all the time) <br/>
I hope it rains there all the time <br/>
And if you ever said you miss me then don't say you never lied <br/>
I'm without you <br/>
<br/>
Tell all the English boys you meet <br/>
about the American boy back in the states <br/>
The American boy you used to date <br/>
who would do anything you say <br/>
Tell all the English boys you meet <br/>
about the American boy back in the states <br/>
The American boy you used to date <br/>
who would do anything you say, <br/>
who would do anything you say <br/>

Never gonna get it right, you're never gonna get it(15x) <br/>
<br/>
O.k no more songs about you. After this one I am done. You're gone.[repeat until end] <br/>

						K., here's your ride<br/>
Get your petals out and lay them in the aisle<br/>
Pretend your garden grew<br/>
And that it's your day to wed<br/>
We have found your man<br/>
He is drinking up<br/>
He's all-American, and he'll drive<br/>
He has volunteered with grace to end your life<br/>
We'll tidy up<br/>
It's sad to hold, but leave your shell to us<br/>
You explode, you firefly, you tiny boat with oars<br/>
Feather oars<br/>
The world tilts back and pours and pours<br/>
And so, you satellite<br/>
You're a tidal wave<br/>
You're a big surprise <br/>
And I've one more night to be your mother<br/>
<br/>
The signal interrupted<br/>
My baby's frequency not strong enough<br/>
Remain in my hands and smile<br/>
<br/>
We will miss you but in time you'll get set up<br/>
And we will write<br/>
<br/>
Hey, you beauty supreme<br/>
Yeah, you were right about me<br/>
But can I get myself out from underneath<br/>
This guilt that will crush me<br/>
In the choir, I saw our sad Messiah<br/>
He was bored and tired of my laments<br/>
He said, ""I died for you one time, but never again""<br/>
<br/>
Never again . . .<br/>
<br/>
Well I love you so much<br/>
But do me a favor, baby, don't reply<br/>
Because I can dish it out<br/>
But I can't take it<br/>

						This tape recounts a dream which occurred close to the termination <br/>
of approximately 400 hours of intensive, individual therapy<br/>
Now, the patient recounts her dream<br/>
<br/>
I had this dream earlier this morning and I wrote it down<br/>
The dream is that I'm in some sort of a<br/>
and I'm in a hotel I'm at, I'm like at a convention or something<br/>
And I feel sort of almost like there's too much going on<br/>
There are all different kinds of meetings going on<br/>
Stuff on experimental psych and therapy, chemical aspects<br/>
All of it<br/>
<br/>
But, I'm, while I don't mind having all this going on inside of me<br/>
It's sort of, I think I'm going to be relieved when it's over<br/>
When I can sort of settle back down<br/>
<br/>
It's where you live, but you don't know how it's built<br/>
If we're just dust, then it doesn't matter who you kill<br/>
Don't cut me up and tell me that it's ok<br/>
Just turn it off 'cause I don't care anyway<br/>
<br/>
It lit me up<br/>
It lit me up<br/>
It lit me up<br/>
It lit me up<br/>
<br/>
Something's stirring in a deep Atlantic trench<br/>
Doesn't forget the thousand years before it slipped<br/>
It's the beast, it's my heart, it's so brave<br/>
Dive down into its unit in its head<br/>
<br/>
It lit me up<br/>
It lit me up<br/>
It lit me up<br/>
It lit me up<br/>
<br/>
It lit me up like a torch on a pitch black night<br/>
Like an ember in the needles of a dried out pine<br/>
Lit me up and I burn from the inside out<br/>
Yeah, I burn like a witch in a Puritan town<br/>
It lit me<br/>
It lit me<br/>
<br/>
When I grow up I want to be a heretic<br/>
I want to climb over the wall 'cause I'm not on the list<br/>
I want to put my hands to work till the work's done<br/>
I want to open up my heart like the ocean<br/>
<br/>
It lit me up<br/>
It lit me up<br/>
It lit me up<br/>
It lit me up<br/>
<br/>
It lit me up like a rag soaked in gasoline<br/>
In the neck of the bottle breaking right at my feet<br/>
It lit me up and I burned from the inside out<br/>
Yeah, I burned like a witch in a Puritan town<br/>
It lit me<br/>
It was a good dream<br/><br/><br/> </div>"

By number nine with my head on the bar<br/>
And it's sad but true out of cash and i-o-u's<br/>

Barely conscious in the door where you stand. <br/>

Brass buttons on your coat hold the cold<br/>
In the shape of a heart that they cut out of stone<br/>
And you're using all your looks that you've thrown from the start<br/>

In your memory, you're drunk on your automy<br/>

Bursting with fruits falling out from the holes<br/>
With some pretty bright and bubbly friend<br/>

With flesh licking ladies<br/>
While you and your mother<br/>
Were asleep in the trailer park<br/>
Thunderous sparks from the dark of the stadiums<br/>
The music and medicine you needed for comforting<br/>
So make all your fat fleshy fingers to moving<br/>
And pluck all your silly strings<br/>
And bend all your notes for me<br/>
Soft silly music is meaningful magical<br/>
The movements were beautiful<br/>
All in your ovaries<br/>
All of them milking with green fleshy flowers<br/>
While powerful pistons were sugary sweet machines<br/>
Smelling of semen all under the garden<br/>
Was all you were needing when you still believed in me<br/>
<br/>
Say what you want to say<br/>
And pay for your hollow ways<br/>
Moving your mouth to pull out all your miracles<br/>
For me<br/>

Her sister and mother and 500 families<br/>
And will she remember me 50 years later?<br/>

And brothers always come first <br/>

Better scenes, I wish you'd seen me <br/>
Better off if I just let it be <br/>
Better pretend it don't matter <br/>
Better of if I could have her <br/>
Better days since the day I met her <br/>

						Back in school they never taught us<br/>
What we needed to know<br/>
Like how to deal with despair<br/>
Or someone breakin' your heart<br/>
For twelve years I've held it all together<br/>
But a night like this is beggin' to pull me apart<br/>
I played it quiet left you deep in conversation<br/>
I felt uncool and hung out around the kitchen<br/>
I remember I kept thinking<br/>
That I know you never would<br/>
And now I know I want to kill you<br/>
Like only a best friend could<br/>
<br/>
Everyone's caught on to everything you do<br/>
Everyone's caught on to<br/>
<br/>
As if it happening wasn't enough<br/>
I got to go and write a song<br/>
Just to remind myself how bad it sucked<br/>
Ignore the sun, covers over my head<br/>
Wrote a message on my pillow that says<br/>
""Jesse, stay asleep in bed""<br/>
Don't apologize (I hope you choke and die!)<br/>
Search your cell for something which to hang yourself<br/>
They say you need to pray<br/>
If you want to go to heaven<br/>
But they don't tell you what to say<br/>
When your whole life has gone to Hell!<br/>

Everyone's caught on to everything you do<br/>

So is that what you call a getaway?<br/>
Tell me what you got away with<br/>
Cause I've seen more spine on jellyfish<br/>
I've seen more guts on eleven-year-old kids<br/>
Have another drink and drive yourself home<br/>
I hope there's ice on all the roads<br/>
And you can think of me when you forget your seat belt<br/>
And again when your head goes through the windshield<br/>
<br/>
Is that what you call tact?<br/>
You're as subtle as a brick in the small of my back<br/>
So let's end this call and end this conversation<br/>
And is that what you call a getaway?<br/>
Tell me what you got away with<br/>
Cause you left the frays from the ties you severed<br/>
When you say ""best friends"" means friends forever<br/>
<br/>
Is that what you call a getaway?!!<br/>
Tell me what you got away with!!<br/>
Cause I've seen more spine on jellyfish!!<br/>
I've seen more guts on eleven-year-old kids!!<br/>
Have another drink and drive yourself home!!<br/>
I hope there's ice on all the roads!!<br/>

						Keep the noise low<br/>
She doesn't wanna blow it<br/>
Shaking head to toe<br/>
While your left hand does ""the show me around<br/>
Quickens your heartbeat<br/>
It beats me straight into the ground<br/>
<br/>
You don't recover from a night like this<br/>
A victim, still lying in bed, completely motionless<br/>
A hand moves in the dark to a zipper<br/>
Hear a boy bracing tight against sheet barely whisper<br/>
This is so messed up<br/>
<br/>
Upon arrival the guests had all stared<br/>
Dripping wet and clearly depressed<br/>
He'd headed straight for the stairs<br/>
No longer cool, but a boy in a stitch<br/>
Unprepared for a life full of lies and failing relationships<br/>
<br/>
Up the stairs<br/>
The station where<br/>
The act becomes<br/>
The art of growing up<br/>
<br/>
He keeps his hands low<br/>
He doesn't wanna blow it<br/>
He's wet from head to toe<br/>
And his eyes give her the up and the down<br/>
His stomach turns and he thinks of throwing up<br/>
But the body on the bed beckons forward<br/>
And he starts growing up<br/>
<br/>
The fever, the focus<br/>
The reasons that I had to believe you weren't too hard to sell<br/>
Die young and save yourself<br/>
The tickle, the taste of...<br/>
It used to be the reason I breathed<br/>
But now it's choking me up<br/>
Die young and save yourself<br/>
<br/>
She hits the lights<br/>
This doesn't seem quite fair<br/>
Despite everything he learned from his friends<br/>
He doesn't feel so prepared<br/>
She's breathing quiet and smooth<br/>
He's gasping for air<br/>
<br/>
""This is the first and last time,"" he says.<br/>
She fakes a smile and presses her hips into his<br/>
He keeps his hands pinned down at his sides<br/>
He's holding back from telling her<br/>
Exactly what it really feels like<br/>
<br/>
He is the lamb<br/>
She is the slaughter<br/>
She's moving way too fast and all he wanted was to hold her<br/>
Nothing that he tells her is really having an effect<br/>
He whispers that he loves her<br/>
But she's probably only looking for...<br/>
<br/>
Up the stairs<br/>
The station where<br/>
The act becomes<br/>
The art of growing up<br/>
<br/>
So much more than he could ever give<br/>
A life free of lies and a meaningful relationship<br/>
He keeps his hands pinned down at his sides<br/>
He waits for it to end<br/>
And for the aching in his guts to subside<br/>
<br/>
The fever, the focus<br/>
The reasons that I had to believe you weren't too hard to sell<br/>
Die young and save yourself<br/>
The tickle, the taste of...<br/>
It used to be the reason I breathed but now it's choking me up<br/>

Haste to disgrace the traitor, do not wait 'till later<br/>

You are calm and reposed<br/>
Let your beauty unfold<br/>

Pale white, like the skin stretched over your bones<br/>
Spring keeps you ever close<br/>
You are second hand smoke<br/>
You are so fragile and thin<br/>
Standing trial for your sins<br/>
<br/>
Holding onto yourself the best you can<br/>
You are the smell before rain<br/>
You are the blood in my veins<br/>

Please ignore the lisp, I never meant to sound like this<br/>
So take me and break me and make me strong like you<br/>

If I can choose, it's only you<br/>

I saw the hospital<br/>
Nurse the shoreline like a wound<br/>
Reports of lover's tryst<br/>
Were neither clear nor descript<br/>
We kept it safe and slow<br/>
The quiet things that no one ever knows<br/>

Keep the blood in your head and keep your feet on the ground<br/>
Today's the day it gets tired<br/>
Then today's the day we drop down<br/>
Give up my body in bed<br/>
All for an empty hotel<br/>
Wasting words on lowercases and capitals<br/>
<br/>
I contemplate the day we wed<br/>
Your friends are boring me to death<br/>
Your veil is ruined in the rain<br/>
By then you like to do without<br/>
There's nothing new to talk about<br/>
And though our kids are blessed,<br/>
the parents let them shoulder all the blame<br/>
<br/>
Keep the blood in your head and keep your feet on the ground<br/>

Long ago wrapped in sheets warm and wet<br/>

In a struggle to find secret songs that you keep wrapped in boxes so tight<br/>
Sounding only at night as you sleep<br/>

In my dreams you're alive and you're crying, as your mouth moves in mine soft and sweet, rings of flowers around your eyes and I'll love you for the rest of your life <br/>
You will see.<br/>

Brother, please, we are one in the same<br/>
And you left with your head filled with flames<br/>
And you watched as your brain fell out through your teeth<br/>
Push the pieces in place <br/>
Make the scar sweet to see <br/>
Don't you take this away <br/>
I'm still wanting your face on my cheek<br/>

God is a place where some holy spectacle lies <br/>
And when we break we'll wait for our miracle<br/>
God is a place you will wait for the rest of your life<br/>

And sweep me under the rug,<br/>

Burning out my center till there's nothing but dust,<br/>

Blame it on the weekends. God I need a cola now. <br/>

Wore our blank expressions, trying to look interesting. <br/>
Blame it all on me 'cause God I need a cold one now. <br/>

All them eager actors gladly taking credit <br/>
For the lines created by the people tucked away from sight <br/>

If you find a way out, oh would you just let me know how? <br/>
Would you just let me know how? <br/>

Blame it on the web but the spider's your problem now. <br/>
Language is for liquid that we're all dissolved in. <br/>
Great for solving problems, after it creates a problem. <br/>
Blame it on the Tetons. God, I need a scapegoat now. <br/>

Everyone's a building burning <br/>
With no one to put the fire out. <br/>
Standing at the window looking out, <br/>
Waiting for time to burn us down. <br/>

<br/>
Ok, we got any gnomes out there?<br/>
Do we got any crazy gnomes out there?<br/>
<br/>
Crazy gnome was walking through the desert <br/>
It was dry and got nothing but the lepers <br/>
And I was beating out their blood and pus <br/>
And all their scabs are know what do, what do<br/>
What do you want with me <br/>
Crazy gnome on a fucking Halloween <br/>
<br/>
Crazy gnome, crazy gnome <br/>
Crazy gnome <br/>
And he’ll go in your home <br/>
He won’t be here when you’re walking down <br/>
But crazy gnome<br/>
He doesn’t care about your hat <br/>
If he’s going off all inside <br/>
If you’re getting yourself a new ride <br/>
Or moving away from your college or parents <br/>
Or moving away from being a sea monkey, that’s great <br/>
Crazy gnome knows what you’re saying<br/>
Crazy gnome, he was awake all day <br/>
And when he went outside at quarter past ten <br/>
Crazy gnome, he started eating raw chicken <br/>
And the things you want, the things you do <br/>
The crazy gnome wants a belt whooping <br/>
You’re crazy <br/>
Crazy gnome, crazy gnome <br/>
Crazy gnome <br/>
Ah!<br/>
Ah!<br/>
Ah!<br/>
Ah!<br/>
<br/>
Well crazy gnome <br/>
He has a wavy cap <br/>
Went to school and then he got home from gym <br/>
He felt wawawawawawa I don’t understand <br/>
I guess he made my jacket my own <br/>
<br/>
Gnome, crazy gnome <br/>
Crazy gnome, crazy <br/>
<br/>
<i>Cheering throughout portion below. This is just Isaac rambling about the gnome. He isn’t singing the bottom part.</i><br/>
<br/>
Every year crazy gnome comes around <br/>
And he looks at all your stuff and he laughs at you <br/>
Crazy gnome is no one’s friend <br/>
If you see crazy gnome near your house <br/>
Feel self-conscious <br/>
Say, “He’s laughing at you and your stuff” <br/>
I saw crazy gnome inside my house twice this year <br/>
I didn’t leave my house for a week each time <br/>
My stuff was violated by the crazy gnome <br/>
You probably don’t even know him when you see him <br/>
“Oh, it’s just that weird little mailman” <br/>
Crazy gnome, crazy gnome <br/>
In your house, looking through your home <br/>
And he’s laughing at your stuff <br/>
Crazy gnome<br/><br/><br/> </div>"

My brain's the cliff, and my heart's the bitter buffalo<br/>
My heart's the bitter buffalo<br/>

We tore one down, and erected another there<br/>
The match of the century, absence versus thin air<br/>

And we will never know just where we go<br/>
Or where we have came from<br/>

These veins of mine are now some sort of fuse <br/>
And when they light up and my mind blows up <br/>
My heart is amused<br/>
<br/>
So<br/>
<br/>
This heart of mine is just some sort of map <br/>
That doesn't care at all or worry about<br/>
Where the hell you’re at<br/>
But you're right there<br/>
<br/>
Well, I've been meaning to dismiss you, yeah<br/>
I have some plans to dismiss you<br/>
So stand by, by, bye, bye, bye, bye,<br/>
Wave bye sugar boats. <br/>
<br/>
As soon as you paint every last grain of sand, as you<br/>
Soon as you paint every star in the sky, sky, sky, sky, sky, sky <br/>
Wave bye sugar boats<br/>
<br/>
Well I'm swatting at mosquitos as they're orbiting me<br/>
I'm orbiting the sun and this goes on and on and on you see. <br/>
This heart of mine is just some broke machine <br/>
And when it get's a goin', and it often gets a goin', <br/>
It starts blowin' steam<br/>
<br/>
Here we go again!<br/>
<br/>
This rock of ours is just some big mistake<br/>
And we will never know just where we go <br/>
Or where we have came from. <br/>
This watch of mine is like some sort of void<br/>
Cuz when I look in, and I shouldn't look in<br/>
I see it swallow my time<br/>
<br/>
Oh no there it goes!<br/>
<br/>
I ain't gettin' on no fast plane<br/>
Hell I ain't gettin' on no stuffy train<br/>
Sugar boats on the Atlantic are fine<br/>
The sugar boats they're just fine<br/>
<br/>
I'll stand on the deck so you can see<br/>
I'll stand on the deck so you can wave bye<br/>
Here's the ghost that waves bye<br/>
I'm the ghost that goes and waves bye bye bye<br/>

I've had enough with rolling boulders, I want more moss on me<br/>

Pockets full as they are able<br/>

						This rock of ours is just some big mistake<br/>
And we will never know just where we go<br/>
Or where we have came from<br/>
These veins of mine are now some sort of fuse<br/>
And when they light up and my mind blows up<br/>
My heart is amused so<br/>
This heart of mine is just some sort of map<br/>
That doesn't care at all or worry about where the hell you're at<br/>
But you're right there<br/>
<br/>
Well, I've been meaning to dismiss you<br/>
Yeah I have some plans to dismiss you<br/>
So stand by, by, by, by, bye-bye<br/>
Wave bye, sugar boats!<br/>
As soon as you paint every last grain of sand<br/>
As you soon as you paint every star<br/>
In the sky, sky, sky, sky, sky, sky<br/>
Wave bye, sugar boats!<br/>
Well, I'm swatting at mosquitoes as they're orbiting me<br/>
I'm orbiting the sun and this goes on and on and on, you see<br/>
This heart of mine is just some broke machine<br/>
And when it gets a-goin', and it often gets goin'<br/>
It starts blowin' steam<br/>
Here we go again!<br/>
<br/>
This rock of ours is just some big mistake<br/>
And we will never know just where we go<br/>
Or where we have came from<br/>
This watch of mine is like some sort of void<br/>
Cause when I look in, and I shouldn't look in<br/>
I, I see it swallow my time<br/>
Oh no, there it goes!<br/>
<br/>
I ain't getting on no fast plane<br/>
Hell, I ain't getting on no stuffy train<br/>
Sugar boats on the Atlantic are fine<br/>
The sugar boats, they're just fine<br/>
I'll stand on the deck so you could see<br/>
I'll stand on the deck you could wave bye, bye, bye, bye<br/>
Here's the ghost that goes and waves bye, bye, bye, bye<br/>

						It was like this in 1999<br/>
It was like this in 1874<br/>
It was like this when you were a child<br/>
It was like this when I was a whore, well<br/>
They were massing troops on the back of the isles<br/>
They were saying those things, they were all in denial<br/>
They were talking about their own front lip<br/>
It smelt like, it smelt like shit<br/>
They were eating popcorn out of a dish<br/>
They're saying, "" I wish, I wish, I wish""<br/>
I was there in 1999, I was left and I left my old self behind<br/>
Still living, but you know I'm not denying<br/>
Said what I said, and I said this<br/>
In 1918 things were better <br/>
When I was nothing but a sweater<br/>
Now I'm born again as another man<br/>
I'm living on this in this foreign land<br/>
I used to be angora, angora fleece<br/>
Isn't no sound and I eat in peace<br/>
And no one knew, and no one cared<br/>
And you didn't know whether you wanted to dare<br/>
It's not what you were thinking then <br/>
And as your resurrection breathed out cinnamon<br/>
And I was not to be confused<br/>
And then in 1882 they still sold it to those fucks<br/>
Things have been going wrong since the beginning<br/>
And no one was losing and no one was winning<br/>
They just fucked each other up<br/>
And in 1999 I was in a park in Chicago<br/>
Oh, that was nice<br/>
He was like a father and he knew what he was saying<br/>
And wait<br/>
I'm not talking about this bullshit<br/>
And I went to talk to the more Italian boys who hung out there<br/>
They said that they would rather see me dead <br/>
Or at least not kept<br/>
And they broke my jaw and I was left to thaw<br/>
And I walked away and I called my mom and said<br/>
""Hell yeah it sucked, yeah, I loved it, break my jaw now!""<br/>
You hang on, you hang on<br/>
You got your ring on and you were just saying, uh<br/>
One thing you remembered <br/>
You were never even once being clever<br/>
Then you were, when sleeping, you were sleeping <br/>
When they're saying when there was a phone, yeah<br/>
Mistakes were made and I ended up in Florida<br/>
Things were not right, I didn't care though<br/>
What you do, and what you become<br/>
Either way you end up all dumb<br/>
That's all right with me now, that's all right with me now <br/>
1-2, 1-2 me with the troops <br/>
They were massing on the porch <br/>
They wanted to be the only thorn<br/>
And in the court of the golf golf center <br/>
I hear things are better and no one's really tougher<br/>
And you're talking loud and you're talking proud <br/>
In your trumpet now, oh shit!<br/>
Well you said then, what you meant then<br/>
What you did then, was you want to have sex<br/>
And you did not do, you could not do<br/>
You could not pull out but you tried to<br/>
Then you said, ""Well, I don't need<br/>
I don't need to wear myself a bikini today!""<br/>
It brings me to the embarrassment<br/>
I was sitting on a raft in pond sediment<br/>
And they said, ""Hell yeah, oh, hell yeah"" <br/>
You looked naked for shit but you were drunk, you didn't care<br/>
Well, what were you thinking?<br/><br/><br/> </div>"

Wake up, get ready<br/>
What a wonderful trip's ahead<br/>
Well, wake up, get ready<br/>
Wake up, get ready<br/>
Such a wonderful trip's ahead<br/>
<br/>
We get dressed as ghosts<br/>
With sheets taken from the bed<br/>
Inside our socks we hide travelers' checks<br/>
We are tourists of the dead<br/>
<br/>
So let's pack up<br/>
Let's go<br/>
So let's pack up<br/>
Let's go<br/>
Let's pack up<br/>
Let's go<br/>
<br/>
Let's go<br/>
<br/>
There was this tortoise, its shell was covered with jewels<br/>
And had been since time began<br/>
It knew the world through all its histories<br/>
And the universe and its mysteries<br/>
One day it came across a man<br/>
The two were talking<br/>
The tortoise offered to tell him<br/>
About the future and how the universe ran<br/>
Oh, the man killed the tortoise, took his shell<br/>
And with a song on his lips walked off again<br/>
<br/>
So let's walk off<br/>
Let's go<br/>
So let's walk off<br/>
Let's go<br/>
Let's walk off<br/>
Let's go<br/>
So let's walk off<br/>
Let's go<br/>
<br/>
Pack a lunch wander 'round<br/>
Toss the map on the ground<br/>
It isn't accurate anyways<br/>
We've been getting away<br/>
We've been getting away<br/>
We are strangers to ourselves<br/>
We sneak out<br/>
Drip by drip<br/>
Through paper cuts on our hands<br/>
Day after day<br/>
Nothing's quite the same<br/>
We are tourists in our own heads<br/>
<br/>
So let's walk on<br/>
Let's go<br/>
Let's walk on<br/>
Let's go<br/>
Let's walk on (I think I feel ready to go)<br/>
Let's go<br/>
Let's walk on<br/>
Let's go<br/>

						Ice age, heat wave, can't complain<br/>
If the world's at large, why should I remain?<br/>
Walked away to another planet<br/>
Gonna find another place, maybe one I can stand<br/>
I move on to another day<br/>
To a whole new town with a whole new way<br/>
Went to the porch to have a thought<br/>
Got to the door and, again, I couldn't stop<br/>
You don't know where and you don't know when<br/>
But you still got your words and you got your friends<br/>
Walk along to another day<br/>
Work a little harder work another way<br/>
Well uh-uh, baby, I ain't got no plan<br/>
Well I float on, maybe would you understand?<br/>
Gonna float on, maybe would you understand?<br/>
Well I float on, maybe would you understand?<br/>
<br/>
The days get shorter and the nights get cold<br/>
I like the autumn but this place is getting old<br/>
I pack up my belongings and I head for the coast<br/>
It might not be a lot but I feel like I'm making the most<br/>
The days get longer and the nights smell green<br/>
I guess it's not surprising but it's spring and I should leave<br/>
<br/>
I like songs about drifters, books about the same<br/>
They both seem to make me feel a little less insane<br/>
Walked on off to another spot<br/>
I still haven't gotten anywhere that I want<br/>
Did I want love? Did I need to know?<br/>
Why does it always feel like I'm caught in an undertow?<br/>
<br/>
The moths beat themselves to death against the lights<br/>
Adding their breeze to the summer nights<br/>
Outside water like air was gray<br/>
I didn't know what I had that day<br/>
Walk a little farther to another plan<br/>
You said that you did, but you didn't understand<br/>
<br/>
I know that starting over's not what life's about<br/>
But my thoughts were so loud I couldn't hear my mouth<br/>
My thoughts were so loud, I couldn't hear my mouth<br/>

And what about science?<br/>

We crashed in like waves into the stars Didn't want it didn't need it but we knew that we could see it so we opened up the door<br/>
We receded like waves out of the stars<br/>

						My grandfather's name was moon<br/>
Because his eyes were bright and round<br/>
And no amount of time or liquor could dull them<br/>
My grandmother's name was joy<br/>
<br/>
Because it spilled out of her heart<br/>
And bathed her precious children in its warmth<br/>
And there was happiness in life beyond the sorrow<br/>
And the pain<br/>
<br/>
But how they ever found it I cannot explain<br/>
I guess time has a way of making everything alright<br/>
It's just there is not enough of it<br/>
And so we drink and we sing and we celebrate<br/>
<br/>
This lie and hope that it will last<br/>
Morning is here night has passed<br/>
My grandfather was a doctor<br/>
He cured the sick with his kind hands<br/>
<br/>
And he taught me how to sail and how to feel this way<br/>
My grandmother was all sweetness<br/>
And when she spoke we all heard bells and<br/>
They ran in such a way that we were comforted<br/>
<br/>
And they held on to each other with all the strength they had<br/>
And they loved with devotion beyond what I understand<br/>
But I guess fear has a way of making sleep unbearable<br/>
And the days seem dark and long<br/>

And we stumble into love with perfect, awkward grace<br/>

There is too much company<br/>

<br/>
Exactly how I feel<br/>

And I will stay here in these dead plains<br/>
And try to make a seed grow<br/>

						Sitting around, no work today.<br/>
Try pacing to keep awake.<br/>
Laying around, no school today.<br/>
Just drink until the clock has circled all the way.<br/>
<br/>
It's late afternoon, as you walk through the rooms<br/>
Of a house that is quiet<br/>
Except for unanswered telephones.<br/>
You stand near the sink,<br/>
You mix up a drink.<br/>
You think you don't want to pass out<br/>
Where your roommates could find you again.<br/>
Stumble 'round the neighboorhod, nothing to do.<br/>
You're always looking for something<br/>
To sniff smoke or swallow.<br/>
Calling over next door, see what they've got.<br/>
But you would settle for anything<br/>
That would make your brain slow down or<br/>
Stop this circle of thoughts you chase<br/>
Before they catch back up with you.<br/>
And your parents notice your thinning face,<br/>
All the weight you've lost,<br/>
All the weight you're losing.<br/>
You said ""I'm done feeling like a skeleton,<br/>
No more sleep walking dead.""<br/>
You're going to wake from this coma.<br/>
You're going to crawl from this bed you've made.<br/>
Stop counting on the camera<br/>
That hangs around your neck,<br/>
Cause it will never remember what you choose to forget.<br/>
<br/>
And you try to find one source of light,<br/>
Try to name one thing you like.<br/>
You used to have such a longer list,<br/>
And light, you never had to look for it.<br/>
<br/>
But now it's so easy, it's so easy to<br/>
It's so easy, it's so easy to<br/>
Second guess everything you do<br/>
Until all you want, all you want is to<br/>
Finish this half empty glass<br/>
Before the ice all melts away.<br/>
This feeling always used to pass,<br/>
Seems like it's every day<br/>
Seems like it's every night now.<br/><br/><br/> </div>"

Beneath the centuries of dirt<br/>

That makes the mess you are cleaning in your head<br/>
And time still drags you forward<br/>
Although you keep resisting<br/>
<br/>
Because you know it is what you leave behind<br/>
You will soon start missing and the people you once counted on<br/>
Says it's all depending on how you act and how you treat yourself<br/>
And that is not very well<br/>

And it's still no better<br/>
You can't seem to fake or force a smile<br/>
Not even a little one<br/>

I want you to come and lay it out for everyone<br/>
Exactly how it was before any of this happened<br/>
And why you can't leave it behind<br/>

Something that would make me never want another<br/>
Something that would make it so that nothing matters<br/>
All would be clear then<br/>

But I guess I'll have to settle for a for a few brief moments<br/>
And watch all dissolve into a single second<br/>
And try to write it down into a perfect sonnet<br/>
Or one foolish line<br/>
<br/>
Because that's all that you'll get so you'll have to accept<br/>
You are here and then you're gone<br/>
But I believe that lovers should be tied together and<br/>
Thrown into the ocean in the worst of weather<br/>
<br/>
And left there to drown<br/>
Left there to drown<br/>
In their innocence<br/>
But as for me I'm coming to the final chapter<br/>
<br/>
I read all of the pages and there is still no answer<br/>
Only all that was before I know must soon come after<br/>
That is the only way it can be<br/>
So I stand in the sun<br/>
<br/>
And I breathe with my lungs<br/>
Trying to spare myself the weight of the truth<br/>
Saying everything you have ever seen was just a mirror<br/>
And you've spent your whole life sweating in an endless fever<br/>
<br/>
And now you are laying ina bathtum full of freezing water<br/>
Wishing you were a ghost<br/>
But once you knew a girl and you named her lover<br/>
And danced with her in kitchens through the greenest summer<br/>
<br/>
But autumn came, she disappeared<br/>
You don't remember where she said she was going to<br/>
But you know that she is gone because she left you a song<br/>
That you don't want to sing<br/>
<br/>
We're singing I believe that lovers should be chained together<br/>
And thrown into a fire with their songs and letters<br/>
And left there to burn in their arrogance<br/>
But as for me I'm coming to my final failure<br/>
<br/>
I've killed myself with changes trying to make it better<br/>
But I still ended up becoming something other than what I had planned to be<br/>
Now I believe that lovers should be draped in flowers<br/>
And laid entwined together on a bed of clover<br/>
<br/>
And left there to sleep<br/>
Left there to dream of their happiness<br/><br/><br/> </div>"

Seems to represent the light source well<br/>
How soft they speak and seem to be at peace<br/>
With the music and the madness that is pulling me into this<br/>

The light, it stains and consecrates<br/>
Anointing all forgotten forms that swirl and smoke<br/>
And haunt this place<br/>
<br/>
The girls in gowns all nurse the dark<br/>
Pulling it near to their swelling breasts<br/>
And watch as it seeps to their hearts<br/>
And beats within their virgin chests<br/>
<br/>
And here I know seduction breeds<br/>
From wanton hearts that would seduce<br/>
And grows and spreads it's vine and leaves<br/>
Embracing those who might have moved<br/>
<br/>
But now remain to drink the night from vials black and thick<br/>
With intoxicating delights would leave you drunk<br/>
Inside this dream<br/>
And you watch them take the light from you<br/>
<br/>
And you find yourself on a velvet couch<br/>
Tasting the skin of a foreign girl<br/>
Her eyes are black and wet like oil<br/>
And she ties your hands with a string of pearls<br/>
<br/>
And you tremble like a frightened bird<br/>
As she closes in and captures you to place you<br/>
In a silver cage deep within her poisoned womb<br/>
So once you're safe inside, she might let you out<br/>
<br/>
To fly in circles around the room<br/>
But it's always night and there is no moon<br/>
And you wonder if you are still alive<br/>
And you're not sure if you want to be<br/>
<br/>
But you drink her sweat like it was wine<br/>
And you lay with her on a bed of blue<br/>
And it's awful sweet<br/>
Like the fruit she cuts and feeds to you<br/><br/><br/> </div>"

And it's inadequate to describe where I am<br/>

						There is a middle-aged woman dragging her feet<br/>
She carries baskets of clothes to a laundromat<br/>
While the Mexican children kick rocks into the street<br/>
And they laugh in a language I don't understand<br/>
<br/>
But I love them<br/>
Why do I love them?<br/>
So the neighborhood is dimming as I smoke on the porch<br/>
And watch the people as they pass enclosed inside their cars<br/>
<br/>
And on their faces, just anger or disappointment<br/>
I start wishing there was something I could offer them<br/>
A consolation, what could I offer them?<br/>
When they are sad in their suburbs, robots water the lawn<br/>
<br/>
And everything they touch gets dusted spotless<br/>
So they start to believe that they haven't touched anything at all<br/>
While the cars in the driveway only multiply<br/>
They are lost in their houses<br/>
<br/>
I have heard them sing in the shower and making speeches to their sister on the telephone<br/>
Saying, ""You come home<br/>
Darling, you come here<br/>
Don't stay so far away from me""<br/>
<br/>
This weather has me wanting love more tangible<br/>
Something I can hold because it's getting cold<br/>
So let's hold up our fists to the flame in the sky<br/>
To block out the light that is reaching for our eyes<br/>
<br/>
Because it would blind us<br/>
It will blind us<br/>
Now I have locked my actions in the grooves of routine<br/>
So I may never be free of this apathy<br/>
<br/>
But I wait for a letter that is coming to me<br/>
She sends me pictures of the ocean in an envelope<br/>
So there still is hope<br/>
Yes, I can be healed<br/>
<br/>
There is someone looking for what I concealed<br/>
In my secret drawer, in my pockets deep<br/>
You will find the reasons that I can't sleep<br/>
And you will still want me<br/>
<br/>
But will you still want me?<br/>
Well, I say come for the week<br/>
You can sleep in my bed<br/>
And then pass through my life like a dream through my head<br/>
<br/>
It will be easy<br/>
I will make it easy<br/>
But all I have for the moment is a song to pass the time<br/>
A melody to keep me from worrying<br/>
<br/>
Oh, some simple progression to keep my fingers busy<br/>
And some words that are sure to come back to me<br/>
And they will be laughing<br/>
My mediocrity<br/>

						Radio: Hi, we’re back. This is Radio KX and we’re here with Conor Oberst of the band Bright Eyes. How are you doing Conor?<br/>
<br/>
Conor: Fine, thanks. Just a little wet<br/>
<br/>
Radio: Oh yeah, it’s still coming down out there<br/>
<br/>
Conor: Yeah, I sort of had to run from the car<br/>
<br/>
Radio: Well, we are glad you made it. Now your new album, Fevers and Mirrors. Tell us a little bit about the title. I noticed there was a good deal of repeated imagery in the lyrics, fevers . . . mirrors, scales, clocks. Could you discuss some of this?<br/>
<br/>
Conor: Sure. Let’s see, the fever is . . .<br/>
<br/>
Radio: First let me say, that this is a brilliant record, man, we’re all really into it here at the station. We get lots of calls, it’s really good stuff<br/>
<br/>
Conor: Thanks, thanks a lot<br/>
<br/>
Radio: So talk a little bit about some of the symbolism<br/>
<br/>
Conor: The fever?<br/>
<br/>
Radio: Sure<br/>
<br/>
Conor: Well the fever is basically whatever ails you or oppresses you, it could be anything. In my case it’s my neurosis, my depression, but I don’t want to be limited to that. It’s certainly different for different people. It’s whatever keeps you up at night<br/>
<br/>
Radio: I see<br/>
<br/>
Conor: And then the mirror is like, as you might have guessed, self-examination or reflection or whatever form. This could be vanity or self-loathing. I don’t know, I’m guilty of both<br/>
<br/>
Radio: That’s interesting. How about the scale?<br/>
<br/>
Conor: The scale is essentially our attempt to solve our problems quantitatively through logic or rationalization. In my opinion it’s often fruitless, but always, well, not always. And the clocks and calendars, etcetera, its just time, our little measurements. It’s like, it’s always chasing after us<br/>
<br/>
Radio: It is, it is. How about this Arienette, how does she fit in to all of this?<br/>
<br/>
Conor: I’d prefer not talk about it, in case she’s listening<br/>
<br/>
Radio: Oh, I’m sorry, I didn’t realize she was a real person<br/>
<br/>
Conor: She’s not, but I made her up<br/>
<br/>
Radio: Oh, so she’s not real?<br/>
<br/>
Conor:  Just as real as you or I<br/>
<br/>
Radio: I don’t think I understand<br/>
<br/>
Conor: Neither do I, but after I grow up I will. I mean, you know what, a lot of things are really unclear for me right now<br/>
<br/>
Radio: That’s interesting. Now you mentioned your depression<br/>
<br/>
Conor: No I didn’t<br/>
<br/>
Radio: You’re from Nebraska, right?<br/>
<br/>
Conor: Yeah, that’s right<br/>
<br/>
Radio: Now let me know if I’m getting to personal, but there seems to be a pretty dark past back there somewhere. What was it like for you growing up? <br/>
<br/>
Conor: Dark? Not really. Actually I had a great childhood. My parents were wonderful. I went to a Catholic school. They have, I had money, so it was all easy. I basically had everything that I wanted anytime<br/>
<br/>
Radio: Really? So some of the references like babies in bathtubs are not biographical?<br/>
<br/>
Conor: Well I did have a brother who died in a bathtub . . . he drowned. Well actually I had five brothers that drowned<br/>
<br/>
Radio: (Chuckle)<br/>
<br/>
Conor: No, I’m serious. My mother drowned one every year for five consecutive years. They were all named Padraic, and that’s why they only got one song. It’s kind of like walking out a door and discovering that it's a window<br/>
<br/>
Radio: But your music is certainly very personal<br/>
<br/>
Conor: Of course, I put a lot of myself into what I do. It’s like being an author, you have to free yourself to use symbolism and allegory to meet your goal. And part of that is compassion, empathy for other people and their situations. Some of what I sing about comes from other people’s experiences. It shouldn’t matter, the message is intended to be universal<br/>
<br/>
Radio: I see what you mean<br/>
<br/>
Conor: Could you make that sound stop, please?<br/>
<br/>
Radio: Yes. And your goal?<br/>
<br/>
Conor: I don’t know. Create feelings I guess. A song never ends up the way you planned it<br/>
<br/>
Radio: That’s funny you’d say that, do you think that . . .<br/>
<br/>
Conor: Do you ever hear things that aren’t really there?<br/>
<br/>
Radio: I’m sorry, what?<br/>
<br/>
Conor: Never mind. How long have you worked at this station?<br/>
<br/>
Radio: Oh, just a few minutes. Now you mentioned empathy for others. Would you say that that motivates you to make the music that you make?<br/>
<br/>
Conor: No, not really. It’s more a need for sympathy. I want people to feel sorry for me. I like to feel the burn of the audience’s eyes on me when I’m revealing all my darkest secrets into the microphone. When I was a kid I used to carry a safety pin around with me every where I went in my pocket, and when people weren’t paying enough attention to me, I’d dig it into my arm until I started crying. Everyone would stop what they were doing and ask me what was the matter. I guess, I guess I kind of liked that<br/>
<br/>
Radio: Really, you’re telling me that you’re doing all of this for attention?<br/>
<br/>
Conor: No, I hate it when people look at me, I get nauseous. In fact, I could care less what people think about me. Do you feel that?<br/>
<br/>
Radio: No, I feel sick<br/>
<br/>
Conor: I really just want to be this warm yellow light that pours over everyone that I love<br/>
<br/>
Radio: So you’re going to play something for us now? Is this a new song?<br/>
<br/>
Conor: Yeah, but I haven’t written it yet. It’s one I’ve been meaning to write called A Song To Pass The Time<br/>
<br/>
Radio: Oh, that’s a nice title<br/>
<br/>
Conor: You should write your own scripts<br/>
<br/>
Radio: Yeah, I know<br/><br/><br/> </div>"

I'm gonna write another travelin' song<br/>
About all the billion highways <br/>
And the cities at the break of dawn<br/>
<br/>
Well, I guess the best that I can do now <br/>
Is pretend that I done nothing wrong<br/>
And a dream about a train that's gonna <br/>
Take me back where I belong<br/>
<br/>
Well, now the ocean speaks and spits <br/>
And I can hear it from the interstate<br/>
And I'm screaming at my brother on a cell phone <br/>
He is far away<br/>
<br/>
I'm saying nothing in the past or future <br/>
Ever will feel like today<br/>
Until we're parking in an alley <br/>
Just hopin' that our shit is safe<br/>
<br/>
So I go back and forth forever<br/>
All my thoughts they come in pairs<br/>
Oh, I will, I won't, I do, I don't<br/>
I'm not surprised <br/>
But I never feel quite prepared<br/>
<br/>
Now I'm hunched over a typewriter <br/>
I guess you'd call that paintin' in a cave<br/>
And there's a word I can't remember <br/>
And a feeling I cannot escape<br/>
<br/>
And now my ashtray's overflowing <br/>
I'm still staring at a clean white page<br/>
Oh, and morning's at my window <br/>
And she is sending me to bed again<br/>
<br/>
Well, I dreamed a dark on the horizon<br/>
I dreamed a desert where the dead lay down<br/>
I dreamed a prostituted child <br/>
Touching an old man in a fast food crowd<br/>
<br/>
I dreamed a ship was sinking<br/>
There was people screaming all around<br/>
And I awoke to my alarm clock <br/>
It was a pop song, it was playin' loud<br/>
<br/>
So I will find my fears and face them<br/>
I will cower like a dog<br/>
I will kick and scream<br/>
I will kneel and plead<br/>
I'll fight like hell, to hide that I'm givin' up<br/><br/><br/> </div>"

You could choose the high<br/>

You might fork your tongue<br/>
As you curse or praise<br/>
All the things you've done<br/>
And the faders move<br/>
And the music dies<br/>
As we pass over<br/>
On the arc of time<br/>

So you nurse your love<br/>
Like a wounded dove<br/>
In the covered cage of night<br/>
Every star is crossed<br/>
By phrenetic thoughts<br/>
That separate and then collide<br/>
And they twist like sheets<br/>
Till you fall asleep<br/>
And they finally unwind<br/>

With Jesus Christ<br/>
You will get right up<br/>
From that chalk outline<br/>
And then you'll get dolled up<br/>
And you'll dress in white<br/>
All to take your place<br/>
In his chorus line<br/>

And then in you'll come<br/>
With those marching drums<br/>
In a saintly compromise<br/>
No more whiskey slurs<br/>
No more blonde haired girls<br/>
For your whole eternal life<br/>
And you'll do the dance<br/>
That was choreographed<br/>
At the very dawn of time<br/>
Saying, I told you son<br/>
The day would come<br/>
You would die, you'd die, you'd die, you'd die<br/>
You would die, you'd die, you'd die, you'd die<br/>

Of the human heart<br/>
The fear of death expands<br/>
Till we crack the code<br/>
We have always known<br/>
But could never understand<br/>
On a circuit board<br/>
We will soon be born<br/>

And the only, really the only thing she heard him say was<br/>
Was to order his, his Bloody Mary<br/>

Get eaten off the web<br/>
We must rip out all the epilogues<br/>
From the books that we have read<br/>
And to the face of every criminal<br/>
Strapped firmly to a chair<br/>
We must stare, we must stare, we must stare<br/>
<br/>
We must take all of the medicines<br/>
Too expensive now to sell<br/>
Set fire to the preacher<br/>
Who is promising us hell<br/>

My father loads his gun<br/>

Its return to the lonesome ocean<br/>

Sing ecstatic with the whole<br/>
Must memorize nine numbers<br/>
And deny we have a soul<br/>
And in this endless race for property<br/>
And privilege to be one<br/>
We must run, we must run, we must run<br/>

Where the bats and moonlight laugh<br/>
We must stare into a crystal ball<br/>
And only see the past<br/>
And into the caverns of tomorrow<br/>
With just our flashlights and our love<br/>
We must plunge, we must plunge, we must plunge<br/>

Like a painting on a wall<br/>

So I guess it's just as well<br/>

Why do I envy the ending right from the start<br/>
Just get it together to take it apart<br/>
Watching the horse as it follows the cart<br/>

						She was a real royal lady, true patron of the arts<br/>
She said the best country singers die in the back of classic cars<br/>
So if I ever got too hungry for a suitcase or guitar<br/>
To think of them all alone in the dark<br/>
So I laid some nights beside her in a bed made for a queen<br/>
She said I kissed her different, that all the men her age were mean<br/>
Gave me anything I wanted, oh, the generosity<br/>
I took all that I could, it was free<br/>
Now the sky is a torn up denim and the clouds are just splattered paint<br/>
It?s a room I?m renovating, it?s a name I got to change<br/>
If I get out of California I?m going back to my home state<br/>
To tell them all that I made a mistake<br/>
<br/>
And I keep looking for that blindfold faith<br/>
Lighting candles to a cynical saint<br/>
Who wants the last laugh at the fly trapped in the windowsill tape<br/>
You can go right out of your mind trying to escape<br/>
From the panicked paradox of day to day<br/>
If you can?t understand something then it?s best to be afraid<br/>
<br/>
The whole world, it loves you if you are a chic chameleon<br/>
Intersecting circles she could hang with anyone<br/>
But when conducting business she would lie about where she?s from<br/>
Saying, ""Life is how it is, not how it was""<br/>
I learned to listen, felt like I was back at school<br/>
She?d talk forever about the phases of the moon<br/>
Saying, ""Everything is a cycle, you?ve got to let it come to you<br/>
And when it does, you will know what to do""<br/>
Without even knowing I guess I took her advice<br/>
Painted her front door, it seemed a suitable goodbye<br/>
It?s not that often but I think of her sometimes<br/>
Just something quaint, a couple ships in the night<br/>
<br/>
And they keep moving at a glacial pace<br/>
Turning circles in a memory maze<br/>
I made a new cast of the death mask that is going to cover my face<br/>
I had to change the combination to the safe<br/>
Hide it all behind a wall, let people wait<br/>
And never trust a heart that is so bent it can?t break<br/><br/><br/> </div>"

						Hear the chimes, did you know that the wind when it blows<br/>
It is older than Rome and all of this sorrow<br/>
See the new Pyramids down in old Manhattan<br/>
From the roof of a friend I watched an empire ending<br/>
Heard it loud and long, the river's song<br/>
Time marching on, to a mad man's drum<br/>
<br/>
Don't forget what you've learned<br/>
All you give is returned<br/>
And if life seems absurd<br/>
What you need is some laughter<br/>
And a season to sleep<br/>
And a place to get clean<br/>
Maybe Los Angeles<br/>
Somewhere no one's expecting<br/>
<br/>
On a detox walk<br/>
Over Glendale Park<br/>
Over sidewalk chalk<br/>
Some rope read ""start over""<br/>
<br/>
So I muffle my scream<br/>
On an Oxnard beach<br/>
Full of fever dreams that scare me sober<br/>
Into saltless dinners<br/>
<br/>
Take the fruit from the tree, break the skin with your teeth<br/>
Is it bitter or sweet all depends on your timing<br/>
Like a meeting of chance<br/>
With the train station glance<br/>
Many lifetimes have passed in a instant reminded<br/>
Of a millstone house in a seaside town<br/>
When your heart gave out in a mission bed<br/>
<br/>
So your wife gave birth to a funeral dirge<br/>
You woke up purged as a wailing infant<br/>
In Krug Thep, Thailand<br/>

Hear the chimes, did you know that the wind when it blows<br/>
It is older than Rome and our joy and our sorrow<br/><br/><br/> </div>"

Such is the measure of man<br/>
Planets are inset like diamonds<br/>
On a gravity halo, eternity's wedding band<br/>
I slept with that dealer all summer<br/>
The ecstasy is still in my spine<br/>
Coat check I couldn't remember<br/>
Walked into the winter, came out on the other side<br/>
<br/>
And in the South the sun is shining<br/>
Back in the East the lights went out<br/>
<br/>
Stuck on a ladder to heaven<br/>
On trial way back in the Hague<br/>
Lullaby sounds from the engine<br/>
In my Styrofoam coffin, asleep on the interstate<br/>
Black globes, old symbols of freedom<br/>
A murderer still on the lam<br/>
Cities encircled in iron<br/>
On a great silver beltway, democracy's shackled hands<br/>
Séance that brought us together<br/>
Objects we move with our minds<br/>
Coat check and I lost the number<br/>
Short sleeves in the winter, fell back through the other side<br/>

Out in the West the cars are crashing<br/>
Up in the North the ice gave out<br/>

Ask him why, he'll tell you casually<br/>
Washed up, bitter, broken, busted<br/>
Backstabbed everyone he trusted <br/>
Says he sees what no one else can see<br/>
And if I had half his guts I'd want it<br/>
To chase that fatalistic comet<br/>
Die young in the dark; that's poetry<br/>
But it was not for me, it was not for me<br/>

He's always sad but I've never seen him cry<br/>
When he comes to, sure he'll apologize <br/>
Find his car, assess the damage<br/>
Still drunk but he likes the challenge<br/>
Hold on to his mind just like a kite<br/>
But a good strong win can keep you honest<br/>
Fill you with some common knowledge<br/>
Things when we were young we never tried<br/>
Just figured we had time with such a long life<br/>

Money clips, alligator shoes <br/>
One more dance, he's in that champagne room<br/>
She moves like a chocolate fountain <br/>
Pouring, spilling all around him<br/>
Makes him wonder what else she can do<br/>
How bittersweet is love's illusion<br/>
Feelings that cannot be proven<br/>
Trust me, you'll see, my aim is true<br/>
I've done this all for you, I've suffered long for you<br/>
<br/>
So many times he's tried to play it straight<br/>
Worked and worked until his body ached<br/>
But a brand new life can lose its lustre<br/>
Troubles tend to find each other<br/>
Call it luck or you can call it fate<br/>
But either way it's how it happens<br/>
Not the way that you imagined<br/>

Some will say you ain't <br/>

I'm sending the coyote<br/>
To bring you back to me<br/>

Where there's a fancy hotel waiting<br/>
In south San Gabriel<br/>
Where the movie madams sunbathe<br/>
The playboys para-sail<br/>
And I know you think I'm crazy<br/>
But most people they can't tell<br/>
So I'll meet you there tomorrow<br/>
If I can have you to myself<br/>

Inside the time I tried to occupy or waste<br/>
Since you've been away<br/>
It's hard our plans are stalled on calling cards<br/>
I can't see your poker face<br/>
While your voice is sounding so brave<br/>
<br/>
Our Lady Guadalupe<br/>
In plaster on the wall<br/>
Joseph Smith saw Jesus in America<br/>
Well I don't know much about it<br/>
It doesn't matter much at all<br/>
Just keep your head down lady<br/>
As you travel through the dark<br/>
<br/>
And if I should seem distracted<br/>
By the color of the sky<br/>
As a copper wire sunset plays a lullaby<br/>
It's just to know they've stolen<br/>
Another day from you and I<br/>
It gets me feeling low down<br/>
When the moon is fulling high<br/>
<br/>
They bait the route <br/>
To take the place that's safe<br/>
That you might wait a day<br/>
<br/>
A lonesome broken dawn<br/>
That finally comes<br/>
Just as I was losing faith<br/>
You keep every promise you make<br/>

Straight off of the farm<br/>

Tattooed on my arm<br/>
With a pack of Camel cigarettes<br/>
In the sleeve of my tee shirt<br/>
I'm heading out to Hollywood<br/>
Just to have my feelings hurt<br/>
<br/>
That town will make you crazy<br/>
Just give it a little time<br/>
You'll be walking around in circles<br/>
Down at Hollywood and Vine<br/>
You'll be waiting on a phone call<br/>
At the wrong end of a broom<br/>
Yes, that town'll make you crazy<br/>
Crazy as a loon<br/>

So, I headed down to Nashville<br/>
To become a country star<br/>
Every night you'd find me hanging<br/>
At every honky-tonk and bar<br/>
Pretty soon I met a woman<br/>
Pretty soon she done me wrong<br/>
Pretty soon my life got sadder<br/>
Than any country song<br/>

So, I gathered up my savvy<br/>
Bought myself a business suit<br/>
I headed up to New York City<br/>
Where a man can make some loot<br/>
I got hired Monday morning<br/>
Downsized that afternoon<br/>
Overcome with grief that evening<br/>
Now I'm crazy as a loon<br/>
<br/>
So I'm up here in the north woods<br/>
Just staring at a lake<br/>
Wondering just exactly how much<br/>
They think a man can take<br/>
I eat fish to pass the time away<br/>
Beneath this blue Canadian moon<br/>
This old world has made me crazy<br/>
Crazy as a loon<br/>

To the super or the news<br/>

Until the diamond is appraised<br/>

						Last Saturday<br/>
I stood in your entry way<br/>
A place where we used to wait<br/>
For cars to carry us away<br/>
Like once in this storm<br/>
They drove me and Justin home<br/>
The music was just being born<br/>
It was all I was longing for<br/>
Now I'm on a plane<br/>
Of singing my songs again<br/>
Oh, please don't think ill of it<br/>
It's the reason I exist<br/>
But you<br/>
You're the crutch of a cripple<br/>
You're the calm of a conscience<br/>
You're the peace that I have found<br/>
When all these voices talk too loud<br/>
Well, you are quietly reassuring me<br/>
With the hands of a healer<br/>
And the tongue of a teacher<br/>
its your voice that I have known<br/>
To be the first one on the phone<br/>
Yeah, you ran all the lights to the hospital<br/>
<br/>
So don't you say to me<br/>
That life's a trap<br/>
The future is nothing but a tragedy<br/>
'cause I'll be out of that window<br/>
Yeah, I'll start wishing to die again<br/>
Just say we're not walking backwards, kid<br/>
And show me to the door<br/>
And I'll walk behind<br/>
Out into the hot sunlight<br/>
Where the world's very much alive<br/>
Even when I close my eyes<br/>
<br/>
Well, should I admit<br/>
That my promise is counterfeit<br/>
That I'm careless and childish<br/>
And that's all I can hope to be<br/>
And would you concede<br/>
That I think only of myself<br/>
I refuse everybody's help<br/>
Who has been reaching out for me<br/>
Well, you reach with the soul of a sailor<br/>
And the swing of a miner<br/>
You have cleared the rock away<br/>
Leaving gold there in its place<br/>
And it is more than anyone could claim<br/>
Oh, with the sense of a banker<br/>
And with the touch of a tailor<br/>
You saved this life for me<br/>
And you have sown it to beauty<br/>
And I am grateful now and I will always be<br/>
<br/>
So would you sing with me<br/>
The song is all I know<br/>
Some truths are told now only in a melody<br/>
So I've been writing a new one<br/>
Yeah, I've been taking my time with it<br/>
It's gonna be so perfect<br/>
It's gonna hold all of us inside of it<br/>
You will see<br/>
If you just add your harmony<br/>
I think it would be complete<br/>
And be worthy of singing<br/>
Becomes a symphony<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, you're the cool of the water<br/>
You're the start of the summer<br/>
Keep me still like a anchor<br/>
In a storm you're the cellar<br/>
When I'm heavy with worry make me light as a feather<br/>
When I'm deafened by anger you're the song I remember<br/>
With the grace of a dancer and the strength of a pillar<br/>
When I'm starving to suffer you just fill me with laughter<br/>
You're a poet<br/>
And a saint<br/>
You are the only one I choose to imitate<br/>
Oh, like the love of a father through the eye of a camera<br/>
It's this picture I have seen<br/>
We're on a sloping hill of green<br/>
And you are walking there beside me<br/>

Leave the dead star lit on her pedestal.<br/>
Leave the acid kids in their green fishbowls today.<br/>

Leave the worried look on your lover's face.<br/>

A train off in the distance; bicycle chained to the stairs.<br/>
Everything - it must belong somewhere.<br/>

Leave the homeless man in his cardboard cell.<br/>
Let the painted horse on the carousel remain.<br/>

The world requires no audience - no witnesses...no witnesses.<br/>

Leave the autumn leaves in the swimming pool.<br/>
Leave the poor black child in his crumbling school today.<br/>

Leave the novelist in his daydream tune.<br/>
Leave the scientist in his Rubik's Cube.<br/>
Let the true genius in the padded room remain.<br/>
<br/>
Leave the horse's hair on the slanted bow.<br/>
Leave the slot machines on the river boat.<br/>
Leave the cauliflower in the casserole today.<br/>

Leave the hot, bright trash in the shopping malls.<br/>
Leave the hawks of war in their capitol.<br/>
Let the organ's moan in the cathedral remain.<br/>

Cause everything - it must belong somewhere.<br/>
They locked the devil in the basement; threw God up into the air.<br/>
Everything - it must belong somewhere.<br/>

You know it's true - why don't you leave me here?<br/><br/><br/> </div>"

Something true I have lacked<br/>
And spent my whole life trying to make up for<br/>
But I found, in a song<br/>
And in the people I love <br/>
They will lift me up out of darkness<br/>

And now my door, it stands open<br/>

						If there is no such thing as time, you're already there, and you're controlling this cycle. You say, ""Man, look what we found here, Einstein,"" or whoever you're talking to, Tesla - whoever you're talking to. Problems of the future can be solved by mankind because you create them. And you have to believe in the future, it's what we have to do. We progress, we always progress - we try to. So the Sumerian tablets, they say the same thing like Genesis said, that there were chariots of fire that came into the sky. And these beings got out of them, and they walked like a man but they had reptilian features. They had snake-like eyes, a tail, and, uh, scales, right? And they were - they were here, and they made slaves out of the people. And where they landed in is what the Bible calls the Garden of Eden. They were trying to inbreed with the people here. The women would die, the babies would abort. But after two thousand years they started taking, the babies started being born and living. And they had tails, they had a few reptilian features. They could phase shift from one dimension to another dimension, and the people who know say it's from the fourth dimension - the next dimension. Space is expanding; there are spirits coming from the center, right? We're going counterclockwise. There's supposed to be eight other universes going counterclockwise, and that's called Superuniverse, you know? And love's always been the message. It's just - circumstances happen, right? People freak out, just flat flip out, you know? Well, that's where Hitler came from, Hitler came from that way. He was an outspoken, charismatic yeller. And, and all these people said, ""Hey, we'll use this guy, hey, look at all these people listening to this guy."" You know what I mean? And so that's just what the trip's like, that. You know? It still exists, and their bloodline goes back - back into Sumerian times. You know, they didn't call it reptilian, they didn't call it that. But they did, because they called him Satan, they called him the Devil, and it's the same damn trip. It's a negative force, coming in on a positive force, because it's a third dimension, right? And for it to solidify or to crystallize, it has to have both elements, right? And you have to keep it in balance, or it will, it will, one of them will destroy the other...<br/>

With fifteen cans of spray paint in a chemical swirl<br/>
She's standing in the ashes at the end of the world<br/>
Four winds blowing through her hair<br/>

In the black hills, the bad lands, the calloused east<br/>
I buried my ballast, I made my peace<br/>
Heard four winds leveling the pines<br/>

The bystanders claimed they saw angels<br/>
Flying up and down the block<br/>
Well, they must have been attached to wires<br/>
I saw one laying in the lawn with a broken arm<br/>
So I called 911<br/>
So that's one less founded opinion<br/>
One more cause for a dispute<br/>
So the street filled like a basin<br/>
Up with cameras and their crews<br/>
And they washed away the rumors<br/>
Leaving just the concrete truth<br/>
It was a spectacle<br/>
No, I, I mean a miracle<br/>
So then I fell like that girl from a balance beam<br/>
A gymnasium of eyes were all holding on to me<br/>
I lifted one foot to cross the other and I felt myself slipping<br/>
It was a small mistake<br/>
Sometimes that's all it takes<br/>
<br/>
Now I'm staring at my wrist<br/>
Hoping that the timing is right<br/>
When the planets will align<br/>
There will be no planets to align<br/>
Just the carcass of the sun<br/>
And those little painted marbles<br/>
Spinning senseless through an endless black sky<br/>
<br/>
(And so it never started and it will never stop just like I am and you are)<br/>

It was in a foreign hotel's bathtub<br/>
I baptized myself in change<br/>
And one by one I drowned all of the people I had been<br/>
I emerged to find the parallels were fewer<br/>
I was cleansed<br/>
I looked in the mirror and someone new was there<br/>
Still I was as helpless as a chess piece<br/>
When I was lifted up by someone's hand<br/>
And delivered from the corner<br/>
My enemies had got me in<br/>
But in all of my salvation I still felt imprisoned inside<br/>
That holding cell that is myself<br/>
So I wait for the day when I'll hear the key<br/>
As it turns in the lock and the guard will say to me<br/>
""Oh, my patient prisoner, you have waited for this day and finally<br/>
You are free! You are free! You are freezing""<br/>

Now I'm staring at the sun waiting for it to explode<br/>
Because a day is gonna come<br/>
Don't know when but it will come<br/>
And then we will finally know the way out of here<br/>
<br/>
And I will throw away this wrinkled map<br/>
And my chart of stars and compass, cracked<br/>
And I'll climb that tree all wet with sap<br/>
To avoid the hungry beasts below<br/>
I'll cut out my lover's tongue and sing<br/>
Of a graveyard gray and a garden green<br/>

No, we won't ever worry again<br/>

Why do we try so hard to stay alive?<br/>
We know that nothing we do really matters<br/>
And it will wash away with time<br/>
It will wash away with time (wash away with time)<br/>
<br/>
But there's a feeling I get when the amp is loud enough<br/>
There's a feeling I get when she smiles at me<br/>
And there's a feeling I get when staying awake with you<br/>
Stay awake with you<br/>
And that is all there is, then that is all I need<br/>
And someday you will see it's true<br/>
<br/>
Body grows tired when no sleep can mend it<br/>
And time has chased and killed all of our friends<br/>
There is no place left in the sky for them to send us to<br/>
Just lay down and let the light come under the door?<br/>
Cover up our dreams, cover up the years<br/>
And you take, our bodies will make raspberries grow<br/><br/><br/> </div>"

						There's a voice on the phone<br/>
Telling what had happened,<br/>
Some kind of confusion<br/>
More like a disaster.<br/>
<br/>
And it wondered how you were left unaffected,<br/>
But you had no knowledge.<br/>
No, the chemicals covered you.<br/>
So a jury was formed<br/>
<br/>
As more liquor was poured.<br/>
No need for conviction,<br/>
They're not thirsting for justice.<br/>
But I slept with the lies I keep inside my head.<br/>
<br/>
I found out I was guilty.<br/>
I found out I was guilty.<br/>
But I won't be around for the sentencing,<br/>
Cause I'm leaving<br/>
<br/>
On the next airplane.<br/>
And though I know that my actions are impossible to justify<br/>
They seem adequate to fill up my time.<br/>
But if I could talk to myself<br/>
<br/>
Like I was someone else,<br/>
Well then maybe I could take your advice,<br/>
And I wouldn't act like such an asshole all the time.<br/>
<br/>
There's a film on the wall,<br/>
Makes the people look small<br/>
Who are sitting beside it,<br/>
All consumed in the drama.<br/>
<br/>
They must return to their lives once the hero has died.<br/>
They will drive to the office<br/>
Stopping somewhere for coffee,<br/>
Where the folk singers, poets and playwrights convene,<br/>
<br/>
Dispensing their wisdom,<br/>
Oh dear amateur orators.<br/>
<br/>
They will detail their pain<br/>
In some standard refrain.<br/>
They will recite their sadness<br/>
Like it's some kind of contest.<br/>
<br/>
Well, if it is, I think I am winning it,<br/>
All beaming with confidence<br/>
As I make my final lap.<br/>
The gold medal gleams<br/>
<br/>
So hang it around my neck<br/>
Cause I am deserving it:<br/>
The champion of idiots.<br/>
<br/>
But a kid carries his walkman on that long bus ride to Omaha.<br/>
I know a girl who cries when she practices violin.<br/>
Cause each note sounds so pure, it just cuts into her,<br/>
And then the melody comes pouring out her eyes.<br/>
<br/>
Now to me, everything else, it just sounds like a lie<br/><br/><br/> </div>"

Speakers on a TV stand<br/>

Hitchhiking back to Zion<br/>
Holding our tears as we flip the album<br/>
What if this leads to ruin?<br/>
You got a soul, use it<br/>
All this despair forgiven<br/>
Rolling away on a wheel of sevens<br/>
Seems like the Queen of Sheba<br/>
Voice through a blown speaker<br/>
One drop and bubbling Leslie<br/>
Calling me home like Haile Selassie<br/>

Pilgrim beside the fire<br/>
Its been a long winter<br/>
We got a lot in common<br/>
Cover our heads as they split the atom<br/>
All of our days are numbered<br/>
I take in some comfort in knowing the wave has crested<br/>
Knowing I don't have to be an exception<br/>
Children they fill the bleachers<br/>
One is the next Caesar<br/>
Keep all their minds collected<br/>
Until it comes<br/>
Until it comes<br/>
Hide the Omega day<br/>
In plain sight<br/>
Too good to be true<br/>

Pilgrim upon the mountain<br/>
Bare foot and still climbing<br/>
Filling the book of hours<br/>
Day after day in the filth and squalor<br/>
We are the chosen people<br/>
Safe from the next evil<br/>
One Love! Magnetic memory<br/>
Reel after reel, spinning within me<br/>
I had the wildest dream last night<br/>
I was swimming with you in that Cenote the Heavens made with black fire<br/>
Just woke up too soon<br/>

Our love would never die<br/>
Well, ha ha ha<br/>

I remember everything<br/>
The words we spoke on freezing South Street<br/>
And all those mornings watching you get ready for school<br/>
You combed your hair inside that mirror<br/>
The one you painted blue and glued with jewelry tears<br/>
Something about those bright colors<br/>
Would always make you feel better<br/>
But now we speak with ruined tongues<br/>
And the words we say arenï¿½t meant for anyone<br/>
Itï¿½s just a mumbled sentence to a passing acquaintance<br/>

You'd always be there<br/>

Our conversations are circles<br/>
Always one sided<br/>
Nothing is clear<br/>

						There's a lot of things I could have done<br/>
Little tokens of my love <br/>
That I was always saving up to spend<br/>
It's the thought that counts, I guess<br/>
Even ones that don't make sense<br/>
Even when it's easy to forget<br/>
<br/>
To much time for the self-employed<br/>
I heard you scream in your mother's voice<br/>
So afraid you'd become her in the end<br/>
You want a life that you cannot live<br/>
But that is what keeps you competitive<br/>
Throw another shower for a friend<br/>
<br/>
Tell me where it is<br/>
Because I'm looking for their happiness<br/>

For the sake now of the argument<br/>
C'mon, tell me where it is<br/>
Because I'm looking for their happiness<br/>

Not yet a mother but a good complex<br/>
You like the boys when they're scared of sex<br/>
What a shame that they grow up to be men<br/>
Well, maybe father does know best<br/>
And that's the reason why he left<br/>
All your pride to the last ditch you defend<br/>
<br/>
It took a while to accept our fate<br/>
And all the chance it eliminates<br/>
Once we did there was nothing to pretend<br/>
Always say there's a time and place<br/>
So maybe ours will consolidate<br/>
If they do I will greet you as a friend<br/>

You can show me where it is<br/>
Because I'm looking for your happiness<br/>

Now you found it all by accident<br/>

Devoted friends, they disappear<br/>

Yeah, there are some things you can't fake<br/>

And to sort through old photographs<br/>
Of a summer long ago<br/>
Or a friend that you used to know<br/>
And there below his frozen face<br/>
You wrote the name and that ancient date<br/>
And you can't believe that he's really gone<br/>
When all that's left is a fucking song<br/>

My eyes have turned red as stop-lights.<br/>

But there's this burn in my stomach,<br/>
And there's this pain in my side.<br/>
When I kneel at the toilet, <br/>
And the morning's clean light pores in through the window.<br/>
Sometimes I pray I don't die.<br/>
I'm a goddamn hypocrite.<br/>
Then night rolls around, <br/>
And it all starts making sense.<br/>

						Leave the bright blue door on the whitewashed wall.<br/>
Leave the death ledger under City Hall.<br/>
Leave the joyful air in that rubber ball today.<br/>
<br/>
Leave the lilac print on the linen sheet.<br/>
Leave the birds you killed at your father's feet.<br/>
Let the sideways rain and the crooked street remain.<br/>
<br/>
Leave the whimpering dog in his cold kennel.<br/>
Leave the dead star lit on her pedestal.<br/>
Leave the acid kids in their green fishbowls today.<br/>
<br/>
Just leave the sad guitar in its hard-shelled case.<br/>
Leave the worried look on your lover's face.<br/>
Let the orange embers in the fireplace remain.<br/>
<br/>
Cause everything - it must belong somewhere.<br/>
A train off in the distance; bicycle chained to the stairs.<br/>
Everything - it must belong somewhere.<br/>
I know that now - that's why I'm staying here.<br/>
<br/>
Leave the ocean's roar in the turquoise shell.<br/>
Leave the widower in his private hell.<br/>
Leave the liberty in that broken bell today.<br/>
<br/>
Leave the epic poem on its yellow page.<br/>
Leave the gray macaw in his covered cage.<br/>
Let the traveling band on the interstate remain.<br/>
<br/>
Cause everything - it must belong somewhere.<br/>
Soundstage in California; televisions in Times Square.<br/>
Everything - it must belong somewhere.<br/>
I know that now - that's why I'm staying here.<br/>
<br/>
Leave the secret talks on the trundle bed.<br/>
Leave the garden tools in the rusted shed.<br/>
Leave those bad ideas in your troubled head today.<br/>
<br/>
Leave the restless ghost in his old hotel.<br/>
Leave the homeless man in his cardboard cell.<br/>
Let the painted horse on the carousel remain.<br/>
<br/>
Cause everything - it must belong somewhere.<br/>
Just like the gold around her finger or the silver in his hair.<br/>
Everything - it must belong somewhere.<br/>
I know that now - that's why I'm staying here.<br/>
<br/>
In truth, the forest hears each sound - each blade of grass as it lies down.<br/>
The world requires no audience - no witnesses...no witnesses.<br/>
<br/>
Leave the old town drunk on his wooden stool.<br/>
Leave the autumn leaves in the swimming pool.<br/>
Leave the poor black child in his crumbling school today.<br/>
<br/>
Leave the novelist in his daydream tune.<br/>
Leave the scientist in his Rubik's Cube.<br/>
Let the true genius in the padded room remain.<br/>
<br/>
Leave the horse's hair on the slanted bow.<br/>
Leave the slot machines on the river boat.<br/>
Leave the cauliflower in the casserole today.<br/>
<br/>
Leave the hot, bright trash in the shopping malls.<br/>
Leave the hawks of war in their capitol.<br/>
Let the organ's moan in the cathedral remain.<br/>
<br/>
Cause everything - it must belong somewhere.<br/>
They locked the devil in the basement; threw God up into the air.<br/>
Everything - it must belong somewhere.<br/>
And you know it's true - I wish you'd leave me here.<br/>
You know it's true - why don't you leave me here?<br/><br/><br/> </div>"

						Meaning is sometimes hard to spot <br/>
It begins with the flickering of cigarettes <br/>
In the darkness of a dorm room <br/>
Somewhere in the suffocated Midwest <br/>
And if this is real then I was mistaken <br/>
And if there is truth then why can't we find it? <br/>
Beauty comes to those who have been waiting <br/>
For something bigger than themselves <br/>
This is the sound of the hopeless kids <br/>
As they scream from the basements of the houses of their parents <br/>
And this is the sound of the hopeless ones <br/>
As they stare down at their books <br/>
And realize they have been lied to <br/>
But if this is real then I was mistaken <br/>
And the vision fades as quickly as it came <br/>
Consistency like that which I have craved <br/>
Is that people change so unexpectedly <br/>
And realization finds you in a drunken airport <br/>
Some planes depart and others never arrived <br/>
So with this in mind I don't plan on waiting <br/>
If it's time to leave and break these old ties <br/>
Without something else this vision is fading <br/>
But until it's gone the pain will make us try <br/>
But this is the hope I have been searching for <br/>
As the wings catch the sunlight of this cold Nebraska skyline <br/>
This is the dream I am dying in <br/>
I will wake to find tomorrow <br/>
Be content without perfection <br/>
But if this is real then I was mistaken <br/>
And if the vision is gone then I was not aware<br/><br/><br/> </div>"

						I had a girl I knew, She grew, became a woman now.<br/>
I think that she teaches at one of the schools downtown.<br/>
We used to roll the windows down and play the music loud.<br/>
Smoking out in her car, lost in west Omaha.<br/>
<br/>
And we'd get drunk and kiss, our bodies twist like shoelaces.<br/>
And we never came untied, I guess you were just my type<br/>
You know that summer never stopped, I still pretend I'm there.<br/>
The band's in the living room, the neighbors, they never cared.<br/>
<br/>
So when I sat behind the drum set, your heartbeat's what I tried to play<br/>
But with the kick and snare so careless, not in time.<br/>
So you got ahead of me, and I guess I'm still dragging behind.<br/>
I had a friend who changed his name but couldn't change himself.<br/>
<br/>
Never quite figured out, how to deal with what life had dealt.<br/>
He put a needle in his arm to calm his handsome hell.<br/>
Who would've imagined it, could've worked out so well?<br/>
Now he's a shape that moves like echoes through my empty room.<br/>
<br/>
And there's a voice that speaks, like someone's right behind me.<br/>
I turned around and found exactly what you would expect.<br/>
The clothes I left on my floor, the papers piled on my desk.<br/>
But where the ink is wet, the cause, effects, what's meant by it?<br/>
<br/>
The story that is incomplete, the picture's left unfinished.<br/>
So I am writing my own ending, I let my pen bleed black or blue.<br/>
And I will color in the meaning, it will be gold and green and true.<br/>
And I'll learn to love my new discovered proof.<br/>
<br/>
I'll be grateful for this day.<br/>
I will be grateful for each day to come.<br/><br/><br/> </div>"

In a lovely yellow gown<br/>
Now the shops, they are all opening<br/>
In that narrow hallway of downtown<br/>
It's filled with people who are shopping<br/>
For their lovers and their friends<br/>
Saying, ""I won't ever be lonely again""<br/>
Now a forest fenced becomes backyards<br/>
Like songs are born from sound<br/>
And an apple fell and it taught us all<br/>
We are chained here to the ground<br/>
So, I mean, here we go, but there ain't no escape<br/>
These streets are just dead ends<br/>
So I won't ever be happy again<br/>
Now it seems that you too see a painful blue<br/>
When you stare into the sky<br/>
You could never understand<br/>
The motion of a hand waving goodbye<br/>
But as the story goes, or it is often told<br/>
A new day will arise<br/>
And all the dance halls will be full of skeletons<br/>
That are coming back to life <br/>
And on a grassy hill the Lion will lay down with the Lamb<br/>
And I won't ever be lonely again<br/>
But until that time I think I had better find<br/>
Some disbelief to suspend<br/>
Because I don't want to feel like this again<br/><br/><br/> </div>"

						When panic grips your body and your heart is a hummingbird<br/>
Raven thoughts blacken your mind until you're breathing in reverse<br/>
All your friends and sedatives mean well, but make it worse<br/>
Every reassurance just magnifies the doubt<br/>
Better find yourself a place to level out<br/>
<br/>
Got a cricket for a conscience, always looks the other way<br/>
A cocaine soul starts seeming like an empty cabaret<br/>
Hey, where have all the dancers gone? Now the music doesn't play<br/>
Tried to listen to the river but you couldn't shut your mouth<br/>
Better take a little time to level out<br/>
<br/>
I never thought of running<br/>
My feet just led the way<br/>
<br/>
Mixed up signals<br/>
Bullet train<br/>
Cars are switched out in the crazy rain<br/>
I could meet you any place<br/>
If the brakeman turns my way<br/>

All this automatic writing I have tried to understand<br/>
From a psychedelic angel who was tugging on my hand<br/>
It's an infinite coincidence but it doesn't form a plan<br/>
So I'm headed for New England or the Paris of the South<br/>
Going to find myself somewhere to level out<br/>
<br/>
Are your brothels full, oh Babylon, with merry middlemen?<br/>
Never peer out of their periscopes from those deep opium dens<br/>
All this death must need a counterweight, always someone born again<br/>
First a mother bathes her child, then the other way around<br/>
The scales always find a way to level out<br/>
<br/>
I tried to pass for nothing<br/>
But my dreams gave me away<br/>
<br/>
Mixed up signals<br/>
Bullet train<br/>
People snuffed out in the brutal rain<br/>
I could live to any age<br/>
If the brakeman turns my way<br/>
<br/>
It is an old world, it's hard to remember<br/>
Like a dime store mystery<br/>
I'm a repeat first time offender<br/>
Who has rewritten history<br/>
<br/>
Mixed up tea leaves<br/>
Phantom pain<br/>
Fuzzy logic in the the crazy rain<br/>
Getting better every day<br/>
If the brakeman turns my way<br/>
<br/>
Mixed up signals<br/>
Bullet train<br/>
Cars are switched out in the blinding rain<br/>
He'll be smiling as he seals my fate<br/>
When the brakeman turns my way<br/><br/><br/> </div>"

And burned with reasons as to carry on<br/>
Into these twisted months I plunge without a light to follow<br/>

Because I swear that I am dying, slowly, but it's happening<br/>
So if there is a perfect spring that's waiting somewhere<br/>

He believes that they add up to certainty <br/>
And he is upset with fractions that remain<br/>

So I examine these maps with my eyes and at best <br/>
I can trace with my finger all the way <br/>
To that town where she went an attempt to forget <br/>
The cracks and the lines of my face<br/>

So Jetsabel cleaned out the closets for me <br/>

Tomorrow when she wakes she'll come take them away<br/>
And they will never haunt me again  <br/>

But it is still hard to sleep with the moon's heavy beams<br/>
I run barefoot to the backyard<br/>
Just to freeze in my place by the rod iron gate<br/>
Too afraid and ashamed to advance<br/>
<br/>
Today I walked through the snow and found a field of headstones<br/>
They were in rows like the weeks on calendars <br/>
Where each box is a day that you can ever escape <br/>
Without pills for your poisonous sleep<br/>
<br/>
These memories leak from these faucets that weep<br/>
Hot tears splash against the shower floor <br/>
And I stand in the steam as if inside a dream<br/>
I can see her again by the sink <br/>

From behind the bathroom mirror she pulls a thermometer <br/>
And placed it underneath my tounge<br/>
She said, ""You are as pale as a sheet, you look awful my sweet <br/>
Lay down and wait for the sun""  <br/>

Each night from a volume out loud<br/>
She whispered soft poetry, her favorite was Anabel Lee  <br/>
And those words, like these drugs, comforted me  <br/>

But the clocks kept waving their hands and she could not understand <br/>
Why my temperature would never drop  <br/>
And although she promised with tears that she would always<br/>
be here <br/>
I heard truth like the sounding sea<br/>

I said, ""My Arienette, oh, how soon you'll forget <br/>
This house will never be your home  <br/>
And you will leave in the fall when the trees become graves <br/>
And their color lie dead in the grass""  <br/>

Gold and green torture me <br/>
Like the lies I believe too easily<br/>
Oh my Jetsabel, look at this hell that I have made<br/>
If you want maybe drop by sometime <br/>
Put some flowers on my grave<br/>
So that I will look beautiful in my silent sepulchur<br/>
Yeah, that's fine, throw those dresses away <br/>

He moaned, ""Papa,"" he moaned, ""Papa<br/>
Sometimes I gotta vent my spleen<br/>
Sometimes I gotta vent my spleen<br/>
When I get shattered in the heart<br/>
And scattered in the brain""<br/>
<br/>
Well, all the medicine in these sermons<br/>
Still can't keep his brazen nose from turning<br/>
And salvation, it may come free of charge<br/>
But faith always costs him something<br/>
They say there's nothing as sacred<br/>
As the blood between brothers<br/>
When it's pricked from their thumbs<br/>
And exchanged beneath the covers<br/>
Well, Papa, my brother is gone!<br/>
Yeah, my brother is gone!<br/>
<br/>
So would you tell me now how it is <br/>
I'm supposed to get along?<br/>
<br/>
Well, you asked for a chorus but you got a refrain<br/>
Yeah, it's another sad song that moves like a train<br/>
You can't whistle to it <br/>
But you can fast-forward through it<br/>
Flick it off your shoulder like dead skin<br/>
<br/>
They say my head on a plate<br/>
May curve the debate<br/>
About the unbearable high cost of living<br/>
But Papa, everything falls apart!<br/>
Everything falls apart<br/>
And the grass will grow<br/>
As surely as they'll break your heart<br/><br/><br/> </div>"

						I spent a week drinking the sunlight of Winnetka, California<br/>
Where they understand the weight of human hearts<br/>
You see, sorrow gets too heavy and joy it tends to hold you<br/>
With the fear that it eventually departs<br/>
<br/>
And the truth is I've been dreaming of some tired tranquil place<br/>
Where the weather won't get trapped inside my bones<br/>
And if all the years of searching find one sympathetic face<br/>
Then it's there I will plant these seeds and make my home<br/>
<br/>
I spent a day dreaming of dying in Mesa, Arizona<br/>
Where all the green of life had turned to ash<br/>
And I felt I was on fire, with the things I could have told you<br/>
I guess I just assumed that you eventually would ask<br/>
<br/>
And I wouldn't have to bring up my so badly broken heart<br/>
And all those months I just wanted to sleep<br/>
And though spring, it did come slowly, I guess it did it's part<br/>
My heart has thawed and continues to beat<br/>
<br/>
I visited my brother on the outskirts of Olympia<br/>
Where the forest and the water become one<br/>
And we talked about our childhood, like a dream we were convinced of<br/>
That perfect peaceful street where we came from<br/>
<br/>
And I know he heard me strumming all those sad and simple chords<br/>
As I sat inside my room so long ago<br/>
And it hurts that he's still shaking from those secrets that were told<br/>
By a car closed up too tight and a heart turned cold<br/>
<br/>
And I went to San Diego, the birthplace of the summer<br/>
And watched the ocean dance under the moon<br/>
And there was a girl I knew there, one more potential lover<br/>
I guess that something's got to happen soon<br/>
<br/>
Because I know I can't keep living in this dead or dying dream<br/>
And as I walked along the beach and drank with her<br/>
I thought about my true love, the one I really need<br/>
With eyes that burn so bright, they make me pure<br/>
<br/>
They make me pure<br/>
They make me pure<br/>
I long to be with you<br/><br/><br/> </div>"

						My seratonin's rationed, I'm coughing<br/>
I kind of caught the blues<br/>
But you won't catch me complaining<br/>
To the super or the news<br/>
Because the carrot's going to dangle<br/>
Until the diamond is appraised<br/>
And all that talk made me feel rich, baby<br/>
But tell me, who is going to pay<br/>
For braces to make straight<br/>
All that Colgate keep my white tooth innocence<br/>
My smile is in sad shape<br/>
All the dead weight I got tired of carrying<br/>
It's got me looking for a friend<br/>
Or a crutch I can depend on<br/>

Thinking the world is going to end<br/>
I've lived some nights convinced of it<br/>
But I keep waking up again<br/>
With my girl wrapped around my body<br/>
And a towel wrapped around my head<br/>
She said, ""You passed out in the bathtub, angel<br/>
I thought that you were dead""<br/>
<br/>
Don't die on me, don't tread on me<br/>
My love, my love is not the enemy<br/>
You don't have to be no one's biography<br/>
Yeah, they try to write you down and hope you go crazy<br/>

						Love is real<br/>
It is not just in novels or the movies<br/>
It is fact<br/>
And it is standing here right in front of you<br/>
So if you open your eyes<br/>
Oh what a sweet discovery<br/>
There is hope, and there is joy, and there is acceptance<br/>
So now let all of the light that collects on your plants<br/>
Keep you warm, make you smile<br/>
And I will be there with this pen in my hand<br/>
To record all the while<br/>
You'll be laughing so loud<br/>
That the house would shake with sound<br/>
And everything will be as new as the day it was found<br/>
Love is real<br/>
It is not just in long distance commercials<br/>
Or something that you thought you felt back in high school<br/>
So I will turn black and white<br/>
Become that horoscope you're reading<br/>
It predicts something good is on its way<br/>
Oh, and then I will send you the world green and blue<br/>
In a box through the mail<br/>
You can open it up, hold it right in your hand<br/>
And be glad that it's there<br/>
And be glad that you're there<br/>
Now, you can feel all the knots in your stomach start to untie<br/>
And suddenly it's not so hard to say you're all right<br/>
Love is real<br/>
It is not just in poetry and stories<br/>
It is truth, and it will follow you<br/>
Everywhere you go from now on<br/>
So if you'd just cast off your doubt<br/>
Then your lips would answer for you<br/>
Oh my darling, when you smile, it is like a song<br/>
And I can hear it now<br/>
And I can hear it now<br/>
And I can hear it now<br/>
Yes, I can, I can, I can<br/>
I can hear it now<br/>
I can hear it now<br/>
Yeah, I can, I can, I can<br/>

You're gonna lose what you love the most<br/>

Fall asleep reading science fiction<br/>
I wanna fly in your silver ship<br/>
Let Jesus hang and Buddha sit<br/>

The days are long now<br/>
The ups and the sun downs<br/>
And a twisting mind<br/>

I'll do it on my terms<br/>
I'm tired of traitors<br/>
Always changing sides<br/>
They were friends of mine<br/>

Don't hang around once the promise breaks<br/>
Or you'll be there when the next one's made<br/>
Kiss the feet of a charlatan<br/>
Some imagined freedom<br/>
<br/>
All the rest is predictable<br/>
You can say you're the first to know<br/>
Bought a mantra to concentrate<br/>
Car alarm or hissing snake<br/>

How it's gonna turn out<br/>
You've got to calm down<br/>
Or I'll lose my place<br/>
Got to get to the center<br/>
Got to get to the concert<br/>
Run off with a dancer<br/>
Gonna celebrate<br/>
<br/>
We'll welcome the new age<br/>
Covered in warrior paint<br/>
Lights from the jungle to the sky<br/>
See now a star is born<br/>
Looks just like a blood orange<br/>
Don't it just make you want to cry?<br/>
Precious friend of mine<br/>

						If you walk away I walk away<br/>
First tell me which road you will take<br/>
I don't want to risk our paths crossing someday<br/>
So you walk that way I'll walk this way<br/>
<br/>
And the future hangs over our heads<br/>
And it moves with each current event<br/>
Until it falls all around like a cold steady rain<br/>
Just stay in when it's lookin' this way<br/>
<br/>
And the moon's laying low in the sky<br/>
Forcing everything metal to shine<br/>
And the sidewalk holds diamonds like a jewelry store case<br/>
They argue ""Walk this way"", ""No, walk this way""<br/>
<br/>
And Laura's asleep in my bed<br/>
As I'm leaving she wakes up and says<br/>
""I dreamed you were carried away on the crest of a wave<br/>
Baby, don't go away, come here""<br/>
<br/>
And there's kids playing guns in the street<br/>
And one's pointing his tree branch at me<br/>
So I put my hands up I say<br/>
""Enough is enough, if you walk away I walk away""<br/>
(And he shot me dead)<br/>
<br/>
I found a liquid cure<br/>
For my landlocked blues<br/>
It will pass away like a slow parade<br/>
It's leaving but I don't know how soon<br/>
<br/>
And the world's got me dizzy again<br/>
You'd think after twenty-two years I'd be used to the spin<br/>
And it only feels worse when I stay in one place<br/>
So I'm always pacing around or walking away<br/>
<br/>
I keep drinking the ink from my pen<br/>
And I'm balancing history books up on my head<br/>
But it all boils down to one quotable phrase<br/>
If you love something give it away<br/>
<br/>
A good woman will pick you apart<br/>
A box full of suggestions for your possible heart<br/>
But you may be offended and you may be afraid<br/>
But don't walk away, don't walk away<br/>
<br/>
We made love on the living room floor<br/>
With the noise in the background from a televised war<br/>
And in the deafening pleasure I thought I heard someone say<br/>
If we walk away, they'll walk away<br/>
<br/>
But greed is a bottomless pit<br/>
And our freedom's a joke we're just taking a piss<br/>
And the whole world must watch the sad comic display<br/>
If you're still free start runnin' away<br/>
'Cause we're comin' for ya<br/>
<br/>
I've grown tired of holding this pose<br/>
I feel more like a stranger each time I come home<br/>
So I'm making a deal with the devils of fame<br/>
Sayin' let me walk away, please<br/>
<br/>
You'll be free child once you have died<br/>
From the shackles of language and measurable time<br/>
And then we can trade places, play musical graves<br/>
Till then walk away, walk away, walk away, walk away<br/>
<br/>
So I'm up at dawn, putting on my shoes<br/>
I just want to make a clean escape<br/>
I'm leaving but I don't know where to<br/>

Their beauty carved out of absolutes that you could never claim, or even envision.<br/>
Laura you were the saddest song in the shape of a woman. I thought you were beautiful,<br/>

I was just a stranger. But she asked me to care for you. That is what she did<br/>
and I went and betrayed her. But do you know we are in high demand,<br/>
Laura, us people who suffer? Because we don't take to arguing and we are quick to surrender.<br/>
Well, I think I would call tonight if I still had your number.<br/>
Your thoughts have always laid close to mine. We were both skipping supper.<br/>

He falls from the lowest branch of the apple tree<br/>
And lands in the grass, and weeps for his dignity<br/>
Next time he will not aim so high<br/>

As they take eye for an eye, until no one can see<br/>
We must stumble blindly forward, repeating history<br/>

Weak from whiskey and pills in a Chicago hospital<br/>
And my father was there, in a chair by the window<br/>
Staring so far away<br/>
I tried talking, just whispered, ""So sorry, so selfish""<br/>
He stopped me and said, ""Child, I love you regardless<br/>
There's nothing you could do that would ever change this<br/>
I'm not angry, it happens<br/>
But you just can't do it again""<br/>
<br/>
So now I try to keep up, I've been exchanging my currency<br/>
While a million objects pass through my periphery<br/>
Now I'm rubbing my eyes, cause they're starting to bother me<br/>
I've been staring too long at the screen<br/>
But where was it when I first heard that sweet sound of humility?<br/>
It came to my ears in the goddamn loveliest melody<br/>

						I picked you out<br/>
Of a crowd and talked to you<br/>
Said I liked your shoes<br/>
You said, ""Thanks, can I follow you?""<br/>
So it's up the stairs<br/>
And out of view, no prying eyes<br/>
I poured some wine<br/>
I asked your name, you asked the time<br/>
<br/>
Now it's two o'clock<br/>
The club is closed and we are up the block<br/>
Your hands are on me<br/>
Pressing hard against your jeans<br/>
Your tongue in my mouth<br/>
Trying to keep the words from coming out<br/>
You didn't care to know<br/>
Who else may have been you before<br/>
<br/>
I want a lover I don't have to love<br/>
I want a girl who's too sad to give a fuck<br/>
Where's the kid with the chemicals?<br/>
I thought he said to meet him here<br/>
But I'm not sure<br/>
I've got the money<br/>
If you've got the time<br/>
You said, ""It feels good""<br/>
I said ""I'll give it a try""<br/>
<br/>
Then my mind went dark<br/>
We both forgot where your car was parked<br/>
Let's just take the train<br/>
I'll meet up with the band in the morning<br/>
<br/>
Bad actors with bad habits<br/>
Some sad singers, they just play tragic<br/>
And the phone's ringing<br/>
And the van's leaving<br/>
Let's just keep touching<br/>
Let's just keep, keep singing<br/>
<br/>
I want a lover I don't have to love<br/>
I want a boy who's so drunk he doesn't talk<br/>
And where's the kid with the chemicals?<br/>
I got a hunger and I can't seem to get full<br/>
I need some meaning I can memorize<br/>
The kind I have always seems to slip my mind<br/>
<br/>
But you, but you<br/>
<br/>
You write such pretty words<br/>
But life's no storybook<br/>
Love's an excuse to get hurt<br/>
And to hurt<br/>
Do you like to hurt?<br/>
I do, I do<br/>
Then hurt me<br/>
Then hurt me<br/>
Then hurt me<br/><br/><br/> </div>"

						I know that it is freezing but I think we have to walk<br/>
I keep waving at the taxis; they keep turning their lights off<br/>
But Julie knows a party at some actor's west side loft<br/>
Supplies are endless in the evening; by the morning they'll be gone<br/>
<br/>
When everything is lonely I can be my own best friend<br/>
I get a coffee and the paper; have my own conversations<br/>
With the sidewalk and the pigeons and my window reflection<br/>
The mask I polish in the evening, by the morning looks like shit<br/>
<br/>
And I know you have a heavy heart, I can feel it when we kiss<br/>
So many men stronger than me have thrown their backs out trying to lift it<br/>
But me, I'm not a gamble, you can count on me to split<br/>
The love I sell you in the evening, by the morning won't exist<br/>
<br/>
You're looking skinny like a model with your eyes all painted black<br/>
You just keep going to the bathroom, always say you'll be right back<br/>
Well, it takes one to know one, kid, I think you've got it bad<br/>
But what's so easy in the evening, by the morning is such a drag<br/>
<br/>
I've got a flask inside my pocket, we can share it on the train<br/>
If you promise to stay conscious I will try and do the same<br/>
We might die from medication, but we sure killed all the pain<br/>
But what was normal in the evening, by the morning seems insane<br/>
<br/>
And I'm not sure what the trouble was that started all of this<br/>
The reasons all have run away but the feeling never did<br/>
It's not something I would recommend, but it is one way to live<br/>
Because what is simple in the moonlight, by the morning never is<br/>
What's so simple in the moonlight, now is so complicated <br/>
What's so simple in the moonlight, so simple in the moonlight<br/><br/><br/> </div>"

						Our love is dead but without limit<br/>
Like the surface of the moon<br/>
Or the land between here and the mountains<br/>
It is not these hiding places that have kept us innocent<br/>
But the way you taught me to just let it all go back<br/>
<br/>
So we learn to be as faithless<br/>
Stand behind bulletproof glass<br/>
Exchanging our affections through a drawer<br/>
It was always horribly convenient and happening too fast<br/>
You should count your change before you're even out the door<br/>
<br/>
Well, yes you should, but please return, return<br/>
To the person that you were, and I will do the same<br/>
Because it's too hard to belong to someone who is gone<br/>
My compass spins, but wilderness remains<br/>
<br/>
Once too often I've retreated into the depths of my despair<br/>
I built a barricade to block you on the road<br/>
But standing there with all of my possessions piled higher than a house<br/>
I felt closer to you than you ever would have known<br/>
<br/>
So let's let all these tiny acts of charity become ground on which to build<br/>
A monument to commemorate our time<br/>
And though you say you've found another who will surely speed you on your way<br/>
Don't let the forest grow over that path you came there by<br/>
<br/>
But you will, so, so hurry up and run to the one that you love<br/>
And blind him with your kindness<br/>
And he'll make war, oh, war, on who you were before<br/>
And claim all that has spoiled in your heart<br/>
<br/>
But now I tell myself I've mended under these patches of blue sky<br/>
There's still a few holes that let in a little rain<br/>
And so it's crying on my shingles, my floorboards moan under my feet<br/>
The refrigerator's whining so I've got reason to complain<br/>
<br/>
But I'm not gonna bless you with such compliments, some degrading song of praise<br/>
Like the kind that converted you to me so long ago<br/>
Because the truth is that gossip's as good as gospel in this town<br/>
You can save face but you won't ever save your soul<br/>
<br/>
And that's a fact so, so hurry up and run to the one that you love<br/>
And tie him up in your likeness<br/>
And he'll become, become, oh, the prisoner I was<br/>
And know all that has spoiled in your heart<br/>

Bored of cheering me up<br/>
Bored of calming me down<br/>
Bored of drying my eyes<br/>

When you were the one<br/>

You were the blue of the sky<br/>
You came after the storm<br/>
You were the switch on the wall<br/>
In the dark of the hall<br/>
I'm still fumbling for<br/>

'Cause I'm lost in the black<br/>
I don't know where I am<br/>
And arms stretched out in front<br/>
And I'm calling your name<br/>
Just as loud as I can<br/>
<br/>
And I know there's words that we will never speak<br/>
And the questions can't be answered easily<br/>
But I wanted to be easy so<br/>
Nod your head if the plans have changed<br/>
Shake it, love, if they stayed the same<br/>

Start to cry and I'll go away<br/>

Then you sent me away<br/>
Like a messenger bird<br/>
So, I circled the earth<br/>
Blown away in the wind<br/>
<br/>
But I always returned<br/>
With some new little song<br/>
Some sad story to tell<br/>
Of a brief love affair<br/>
With a girl I compared to you and she failed<br/>
<br/>
You said you don't want me to beg<br/>
Then you said get down on your knees<br/>
'Cause you knew that I would<br/>
If I do any good<br/>
Satisfying your needs<br/>
<br/>
And I know all about those things we cannot speak<br/>
And just so you know, well, they don't bother me<br/>
So you don't have to be worried<br/>
Just nod your head if the plans have changed<br/>
Shake it, love, if they stayed the same<br/>
Smile at me and I will stay<br/>
Start to cry and I'll go away<br/>
Just please don't keep me waiting<br/>

Oh, just nod your head if your mind's been changed<br/>
Shake it, love, if some hope remains<br/>

Be born again<br/>

And to be loved<br/>

Because poor people don’t exist when times are good<br/>
<br/>
Mozart’s foster parents put cigarettes out in his ears<br/>
When he got old enough to stutter, he said, “I don’t listen but I-I-I, I can hear” <br/>
The eloquence of traffic, yeah, the mill pond’s sad lament<br/>
It’s a requiem of moments, I keep living through them<br/>
But where is the monster in the closet? I can’t find the hangman inside his hood<br/>
I guess evil don’t exist when times are good<br/>
<br/>
Doctor Oppenheimer winced when he felt the broken piece of his pacemaker<br/>
Unbuttoned his shirt on a subway platform, clutching his chest while his vision blurred<br/>
He saw the bane of his creation. The destroyer of the world<br/>
Yeah, truth can lead to solace or a lifelong bender<br/>
It’s like wading through a wasteland where a town you loved once stood<br/>
You just cry each time you think of when times were good<br/>
<br/>
Napoleon’s tailor dressed him in a giant hat and funny platform shoes<br/>
He said, “Anyone can be a hero, you just got to force people to look up to you”<br/>
So when you’re talking on the hotline to a suicidal soul<br/>
Don’t let your voice sound like hot coffee, more like a scented pillow<br/>
And strive for understanding over being understood <br/>
<br/>
Just don’t let yourself forget when the times get good<br/>
When times get good<br/>
When times get good<br/><br/><br/> </div>"

And like Neely O'Hara you swallow your sleep<br/>
And wake up in the morning<br/>
To find you are not who you used to be<br/>
You don't recognize the behavior<br/>

						It was in the march of the winter I turned seventeen<br/>
That I bought those pills<br/>
I thought I would need<br/>
And I wrote a letter to my family<br/>
Said it's not your fault<br/>
And you've been good to me<br/>
Just lately I've been feeling<br/>
Like I don't belong<br/>
Like the ground's not mine to walk upon<br/>
And I've heard that music<br/>
Echo through the house<br/>
Where my grandmother drank<br/>
By herself<br/>
And I sat watching a flower<br/>
As it was withering<br/>
I was embarrassed by its honesty<br/>
So I'd prefer to be remembered as a smiling face<br/>
Not this fucking wreck<br/>
That's taken its place<br/>
<br/>
So please forgive what I have done<br/>
No you can't stay mad at the setting sun<br/>
'Cause we all get tired, I mean eventually<br/>
There is nothing left to do but sleep<br/>
<br/>
But spring came bearing sunlight<br/>
Those persuasive rays<br/>
So I gave myself a few more days<br/>
My salvation it came, quite suddenly<br/>
When Justin spoke very plainly<br/>
He said ""Of course it's your decision,<br/>
But just so you know,<br/>
If you decide to leave,<br/>
Soon I will follow""<br/>
<br/>
I wrote this for a baby<br/>
Who has yet to be born<br/>
My brother's first child<br/>
I hope that womb's not too warm<br/>
'Cause it's cold out here<br/>
And it'll be quite a shock<br/>
To breathe this air<br/>
To discover loss<br/>
So I'd like to make some changes<br/>
Before you arive<br/>
So when your new eyes meet mine<br/>
They won't see no lies<br/>
Just love.<br/>
Just love.<br/>
<br/>
I will be pure<br/>
No, no, I know i will be pure<br/>

Who sailed around the world and found<br/>
That nothing else exists<br/>
Beyond its own two sails<br/>
And wooden shell <br/>
And what is held within<br/>
All else is sure to pass<br/>

And debate what's truly permanent<br/>

And there are people singing praises<br/>
Say, ""It's all because of him""<br/>
And there is a bird perched on a frayed, wet wire<br/>
<br/>
And his voice sings out for a lover<br/>
But it's covered by the choir of voices<br/>
Reaching way beyond the rafters<br/>
With devotion, they perform these sacred tasks<br/>
<br/>
They cross themselves and offer up their checkbooks<br/>
Slight suffering is not too much to ask<br/>
Besides, we all are making money<br/>
And we are all fucking alone<br/>

On a fresh new mound of dirt<br/>

When the darkness finally swallowed him<br/>
<br/>
Was he calm and content?<br/>
Or was he sweating in a struggle to keep breathing<br/>
Ripping apart the sheets that dressed his bed<br/>
Crying out loud for someone to help him<br/>
<br/>
And collapsing on his back, all pale and dead?<br/>
Maybe it's me who's this unstable<br/>
Always obsessed about the end<br/>
Why can't I let what happens happen?<br/>
<br/>
And just enjoy the time I spend<br/>
Oh, how I wish it was so easy<br/>

I don't want to risk our paths crossing some day<br/>

And the future hangs over our heads<br/>
And it moves with each current event<br/>
Until it falls around like a cold, steady rain<br/>
Just stay in when it's looking this way<br/>
<br/>

Forcing everything metal to shine<br/>
And the sidewalk holds diamonds like a jewlery store case<br/>
They argue ""Walk this way, now, walk this way""<br/>

So I'm always pacing around or walking away<br/>
<br/>
And I'm drinking the ink from my pen<br/>
And I'm balancing history books up on my head<br/>
And it all boils down to one quotable phrase<br/>
""If you love something, give it away""<br/>

A good woman would pick you apart<br/>
A box full of suggestions for a possible heart<br/>
And you may be offended, you may be afraid<br/>

With the noise in the background from a televised war<br/>
And in that deafening pleasure, I thought I heard someone say<br/>
""If we walk away, they'll walk away""<br/>

But greed is a bottomless pit <br/>
And all freedom's a joke, we're just taking a piss <br/>
And the whole world must watch the sad comic display <br/>

I feel more like a stranger each time I come home<br/>
So, I'm making a deal with the devils of fame<br/>

<br/>
You'll be free, child, once you have died <br/>
From the shackles of language, and measurable time <br/>
And then we can trade places, play musical graves <br/>
Until then walk away, walk away, walk away . . .<br/>

						The heat comes in distant shifts to fill up my room <br/>
It spills out of these ancient vents to meet the new cold <br/>
And I lay in my twisted sheets and stare out at the snow <br/>
Still thinking of the next few months, my cold and lifeless eyes <br/>
I've never felt so separate <br/>
And then there's you, but that's so obvious <br/>
It's hopeless and I know this, that's why I can't dream <br/>
No desire or circumstance would keep this from me <br/>
One by one, to department stores <br/>
We walk through the aisles <br/>
In a forest of designer clothes, you touch me and smile <br/>
And for a moment I could want nothing <br/>
Your bright eyes burn through my exploding heart <br/>
And we stand as the shoppers pass us <br/>
And for once I can feel a touch complete <br/>
And I need to just be near you and fill these empty eyes <br/>
But you start turning as resistance pulls you from my cold and boring life <br/>
Let's make this easy and let time pass, as devotion dies<br/>
The list goes on and on <br/>
I have waited and I will be waiting for the pain to cure the fear<br/><br/><br/> </div>"

How did this happen?<br/>

Entwined under the trees<br/>
Nothing prepares you<br/>
And nothing prepares you<br/>
For such an endless dream<br/>
To pour itself on you<br/>
And the world swelled around us<br/>
And the world swelled around us<br/>
And there was brilliant light, but we were far more radiant<br/>
And it is in this light we are lost <br/>
The scent of summer in our hair<br/>
And laying on our bed of grass<br/>
With pleasure thick and sticking to the air (to the air)<br/>

						Poison Oak, some boyhood bravery<br/>
When a telephone was a tin can on a string<br/>
And I fell asleep with you still ctalking to me<br/>
You said you weren't afraid to die<br/>
<br/>
In Polaroids you were dressed in women's clothes<br/>
Were you made ashamed, why'd you lock them in the drawer?<br/>
<br/>
Well I don't think that I ever loved you more<br/>
Than when you turned away<br/>
When you slammed the door<br/>
When you stole the car drove towards Mexico<br/>
And you wrote bad checks just to fill your arm<br/>
<br/>
I was young enough, I still believed in war<br/>
Well let the poets cry themselves to sleep<br/>
And all their tearful words would turn back into steam<br/>
<br/>
But me I'm a single cell on a serpents tongue<br/>
There's a muddy field where a garden was<br/>
And I'm glad you got away<br/>
But I'm still stuck out here<br/>
My clothes are soaking wet from your brothers tears<br/>
<br/>
And I never thought this life was possible<br/>
You're the yellow bird that I've been waiting for<br/>

The end of paralysis, I was a statuette<br/>
Now I'm drunk as hell on a piano bench<br/>

And watching the smoke fill the living room<br/>
As you rested your feet on my coffee table<br/>
And we watched something on TV<br/>
Talked about the world<br/>
But the lines were already drawn from the magazines <br/>
And you called me a sponge<br/>
And you were just like diamond coated plastic<br/>
Just plastic, so invincible, so invincible<br/>
But it's not like that at all, it's not like that anymore and I'm not <br/>
Like that anymore<br/>
<br/>
And I got to hold my breath<br/>
Because the puddle that got you is bound to get me too<br/>
And I shouldn't hold my breath<br/>
Because a sponge like you needs a puddle to go to<br/>
And I, I have breathing room<br/>
Because the puddle in which you fell <br/>
My diamond coated plastic could repel<br/>
Could repel, could repel<br/>
Diamond coated plastic could repel<br/>
Could repel<br/>
My diamond coated plastic could repel<br/>
<br/>
And I will repel you just like you're one of the others<br/>
And I will expel you just like you're one of the others<br/>
Because you are, one of the others now<br/>
It's kind of weird, I think, the way that people change<br/>
Think you know someone, but you don't, but you can't <br/>
So come up, so come up<br/>
Because I don't even care anymore<br/>
Because you'll never be alone<br/>
And I'll always be alone<br/>
<br/>
Because you're a sponge<br/>
Because you're a sponge<br/>
Because you're a sponge<br/>
Who would ever guess it?<br/>
Not me, not me, but I don't even know anymore<br/>
And how am I to know anymore<br/>
<br/>
And I, I'm out of breath, because I've been holding it for years<br/>
And holding back the tears<br/>
Please let me catch my breath<br/>
And soak up a puddle there<br/>
And scrambling for air<br/>
I finally got my breath<br/>
And now at least I know for sure <br/>
I'm a puddle stomper, stomper, stomper, stomper, stomper, stomper<br/>
I am a puddle stomper, stomper<br/>
I'm a puddle stomper<br/>
I'm a puddle stomper<br/>

So I talk but no one can relate<br/>

We all accept in the same tired way<br/>
The gentle shift of continuous change<br/>
We confuse all the things that we say to ourselves<br/>
To the things we say to each other, always a lie<br/>
But at least we find some comfort for a while<br/>
<br/>
So we'll start where the others left off<br/>
Get in our cars and embrace something new<br/>
To escape, we will always get caught<br/>
In the fear that what you had before was better<br/>

I'm here sewing mine together<br/>

Dig deep to every gasp of air <br/>

I have my drugs, I have my woman<br/>
They keep away my loneliness<br/>
My parents they have their religion<br/>
But sleep in separate houses<br/>

I read the body count out of the paper<br/>
And now its written all over my face<br/>
No one ever plans to sleep out in the gutter<br/>
Sometimes that's just the most comfortable place<br/>

So I'm drinking, breathing, writing, singing<br/>
Everyday I'm on the clock<br/>
My mind races with all my longings<br/>
But can't keep up with what I got<br/>

So I hope I don't sound too ungrateful<br/>

A telephone to talk to strangers<br/>
Machine guns and a camera lens<br/>

Your shadows alone but the day is young<br/>

There's no oil in the lamp<br/>
And I'd like to write my congressman<br/>
But I can't afford the stamp<br/>

So you can propagate your lie<br/>
While there's barefoot dudes down in New Orleans<br/>
Looking like they're gonna die<br/>

You who poisoned all of my dreams<br/>
You pinned all of the medals on<br/>

How to gather and analyze<br/>
Nothing is living if nothing dies<br/>
What an exception to make<br/>
Roundly rejecting our faith<br/>

When singularity comes<br/>
We will be fully revealed<br/>
Wandering limitless fields<br/>

When singularity comes<br/>
We will be abstraction then<br/>
We will buried within<br/>
All will be balanced<br/>
We will be one<br/>
<br/>
Now we're on our way<br/>
All of our instincts accelerate <br/>
Nothing you imagine could keep this pace<br/>
We will know freedom at last<br/>
Finally make up for the past<br/>
<br/>
When singularity comes<br/>
We will be faster than light<br/>
Whistling, skipping through time<br/>
<br/>
When singularity comes<br/>
We will be children again<br/>
We will be cradled within<br/>
We will be perfect<br/>
We will be one<br/>
<br/>
When singularity comes<br/>
<br/>
Living in one mind<br/>
Every pin drop is amplified<br/>
Every outcome before its tried<br/>
Will make a rag doll of God<br/>
Wind up our new music box<br/>
<br/>
When singularity comes<br/>
We will be fully revealed<br/>
Wandering limitless fields<br/>
<br/>
When singularity comes<br/>
We'll be completely awake<br/>
Neophyte make no mistake<br/>
We're in this together<br/>
We will be one<br/>

Don't say you felt obliged<br/>

Come on along, is your timid tongue <br/>
Too shy to tell your story?<br/>
This pain in you so far removed <br/>
From anything you've known <br/>
So I won't condone another moan <br/>
When everything is fine<br/>
<br/>
So when in drought, learn to dance<br/>
And pray the dead would return<br/>
<br/>
Dream smoke without fire<br/>
Just come see me again when it burns<br/>
<br/>
Somewhere along the way <br/>
Well, I was led astray <br/>
By a wolf in no one's clothing <br/>
It was a brilliant disguise <br/>
<br/>
And I forgot that life existed <br/>
I thought it was just some kind of game<br/>
That's what brings me to your doorstep <br/>
Though I don't know why I came today<br/>
<br/>
Standing still in the dust<br/>
Giving up on the rain<br/>
As with smoke without fire <br/>
I've already laid in the flames<br/>

They smoke themselves to death waiting for the band to begin<br/>

They have been tuning up there for an hour now<br/>
And I don't think I can stand another minute more<br/>
But just then the first chord strums<br/>
And the drums set in<br/>
<br/>
And I know what I have been waiting around for<br/>
Because no one's going home until the morning comes<br/>
No one's going to sleep until the sun comes up<br/>
Did you hear those first two songs?<br/>
<br/>
They were fucking touch<br/>
And the band is not going to stop until the cops show up<br/>
So hold your applause until the end<br/>
And wait for the sadness to set in<br/>

There's too many opinions and so few are worth a shit<br/>

And it is only when I'm angry that I feel complete<br/>

And you sink in your chair,<br/>
Brush the snow from your hair<br/>
And drink the cold away.<br/>

I'm standing on a bridge in the town where I lived<br/>
As a kid with my mom and my brothers.<br/>
And then the bridge disappears<br/>
And I'm standing on air<br/>
With nothing holding me.<br/>
And I hang like a star,<br/>
Fucking glow in the dark,<br/>
For all those starving eyes to see,<br/>
Like the ones we've wished on.<br/>

You leave a wake of tongues still waving after you<br/>
And it isn't no coincidence where you finally choose to stand<br/>
I guess soon you will be leaving your man<br/>

Hey, you are just trying to be nice<br/>
But there is a meaning to every fleeting action you unconsciously decide<br/>
The clocks, they chime, now it's time<br/>

I know you try and play it cool but there are some thoughts<br/>
You just can't hide, only in your closest friends do you confide<br/>
The way you say you'll be seeing me, oh, like it's so offhand<br/>
I guess soon you will be leaving your man<br/>

The sunrise and the sunsets, you realise then you forget what you've been trying to retain<br/>
<br/>
But everybody knows it's all about the things that get stuck inside of your head<br/>
Like the songs your roommate sings, a vision of her body as she stretches out on your bed<br/>
And she raised her hands in the air, asked you when was the last time you looked in the mirror<br/>
Because you've changed<br/>

The sunrise, the sunsets, you're hopeful and then you regret, the circle never breaks<br/>
With a sunrise and a sunset, there's a change of heart or address, is there nothing that remains?<br/>
For a sunrise or a sunset, you're manic or you're depressed, will you ever feel okay?<br/>
For a sunrise or a sunset, your lover is an actress, did you really think she'd stay?<br/>
<br/>
For a sunrise or a sunset, you're either coming or you just left, but you're always on the way<br/>
Towards a sunrise or a sunset, a scribble or a sonnet, they are really just the same<br/>
To the sunrise or a sunset, the master and his servant have exactly the same fate<br/>
It's a sunrise and a sunset, from a cradle to a casket, there is no way to escape<br/>
The sunrise and a sunset, hold your sadness like a puppet, keep putting on the play<br/>
<br/>
But everything you do is leading to the point where you just won't know what to do<br/>
At that moment you may laugh but there is someone there who will be laughing louder than you<br/>
So it's true, the trick is complete, you become everything you said you never would be<br/>
You're a fool; you're a fool!<br/>

Lying still in the grass and felt the heat from the ground<br/>
<br/>
Rising up to contract and expand like a breathe<br/>
We escape from that place<br/>
Soaked with sweat and the poison we drank<br/>
Fill the bathtub with ice and hope this fever will break<br/>
<br/>
Like a heart<br/>
Easily<br/>
But I do not recall all the words that were formed<br/>
On those wire lips as they greeted me<br/>
<br/>
A promise was made without though as the temperature climbed<br/>
And I started to sink like the moon<br/>
Tends to do if you stare at it too long<br/>
Then you blink and its gone<br/>
<br/>
And we crawl to our sleep with the dawn<br/>
I awake in the light feeling hollow and selfishly warm<br/>
Close the blinds and retreat until what is burning is gone<br/>
And it's light is away<br/>
<br/>
Then we are back in the dark<br/>
Chasing nothing through backyards and trees<br/>
You ripped your shirt on a fence but it didn't get me<br/>
Yeah it's fear<br/>
<br/>
It makes you so low<br/>
And these creatures look crooked<br/>
Their shadows cut lines through my face and the concrete is fire<br/>
Where my bare feet are placed<br/>
<br/>
In a line next to yours<br/>
And I guess I'm not sure if it was fear that was born<br/>
As those awful eyes made their claim on us<br/>
I put my hands on the fence<br/>
<br/>
Said your name<br/>
And I started to climb<br/>
And it must have been sweat but I drank it like wine<br/>
It was sweet and my mouth was dry<br/>
<br/>
I heard you scream but I made no reply<br/>
I can still taste it now if I try<br/><br/><br/> </div>"

						The picture's far too big to look at, kid<br/>
Your eyes won't open wide enough<br/>
And you're constantly surrounded <br/>
By the swirling stream of what is and what was<br/>
Well, we've all made our predictions <br/>
But the truth still isn't out<br/>
But if you want to see the future<br/>
Go and stare into a cloud<br/>
And keep trying to find your way <br/>
Out through that maze of memories<br/>
It all sort of looks familiar <br/>
Until you get up close, then it's different clearly<br/>
But each time you turn a corner<br/>
You're right back where you were <br/>
And your only hope is that forgetting <br/>
Might make a door appear <br/>
Is it your fear of being buried <br/>
That makes you so afraid to speak? <br/>
An avalanche of opinions <br/>
Like the one that fell that I'm now underneath <br/>
It was my voice that moved the first rock <br/>
And I would do it all again<br/>
I mean, it's cool if you keep quiet<br/>
But I like singing <br/>
So I'll be holding my note and stomping <br/>
And strumming and feeling so very lucky<br/>
And there is nothing I know except a lifetime's one moment<br/>
And wishing will just leave you empty <br/>
So you can try to live in darkness <br/>
But you will never shake the light <br/>
No, it will greet you every morning<br/>
Make you more aware with its absence at night <br/>
When you're wrapped up in your blankets, baby<br/>
That comfortable cocoon <br/>
But I've seen the day of your awakening, boy<br/>
And it's coming soon<br/>
So go ahead and lose yourself in liquor<br/>
And you can praise the clouded mind <br/>
But it isn't what you're thinking, no<br/>
It's the course of history, your position in line <br/>
You're just a piece of the puzzle<br/>
So I think you'd better find your place <br/>
And don't go blaming your knowledge<br/>
On some fruit you ate <br/>
Because there's been a great deal of discussion, yes<br/>
About the properties of man<br/>
I mean, animal or angel<br/>
You were carved from bone but your heart is just sand<br/>
And the wind is going to scatter it <br/>
And cover everything with love<br/>
So if it makes you happy then keep kneeling<br/>
But I'm standing up<br/>
Because this veil it has been lifted, yes<br/>
My eyes are wet with clarity <br/>
I've been a witness to such wonders, yes<br/>
I have searched for them all across this country <br/>
But I think I'll be returning now<br/>
To the town where I was born<br/>
And I understand you must keep moving, friend<br/>
But I'm headed home <br/>
Yeah, I'm going follow the road <br/>
And let the scenery sweeping by easily enter my body <br/>
I will send this message in code, underground<br/>
Through forests and deserts and cities <br/>
All across electric wire, it's a baited line<br/>
Yeah, the hook's in deep, boys, there's no more time <br/>
So you can struggle in the water<br/>
Be too stubborn to die <br/>
Or you can just let go <br/>
And be lifted to the sky<br/><br/><br/> </div>"

And does he sing to you incessantly from the space between your bed and wall?<br/>
Does he walk around all day at school with his feet inside your shoes?<br/>
Looking down every few steps to pretend he walks with you.<br/>
Does he know that place below your neck that is your favorite to be touched<br/>
And does he cry through broken sentences like I love you far too much?<br/>
Does he lay awake listening to your breath?<br/>
Worried that you smoke too many cigarettes.<br/>
Is he coughing now on a bathroom floor?<br/>
For every speck of tile there are a thousand more<br/>
That you won't ever see but most hold inside yourself eternally.<br/>

I drug your ghost across the country and we plotted out my death.<br/>
In every city, memories would whisper: ""Here is where you rest.""<br/>
I was determined in Chicago but I dug my teeth into my knees<br/>
And I settled for a telephone and sang into your machine.<br/>
<br/>
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine<br/>
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine<br/>

I kissed a girl with a broken jaw that her father gave to her.<br/>
She had eyes bright enough to burn me. They reminded me of yours.<br/>
In a story told she was a little girl in a red-rouge,<br/>
Sun-bruised field and there were rows of ripe tomatoes where a secret was concealed.<br/>
And it rose like thunder, clapped under our hands.<br/>
And it stretched for centuries to a diary entry's end where I wrote,<br/>
<br/>
You make me happy whoa!  When the skies are gray<br/>
You make me happy whoa!  The skies are gray and gray and gray.<br/>

Well the clock's heart it hangs inside its open chest with its hands<br/>
Stretched towards the calendar hanging itself but I will not weep for those dying days.<br/>

This clumsy form that I despise<br/>
Scattered easy in her hand<br/>

And it came to rest upon a beach<br/>
With a million others there<br/>
We sat and waited for the sea<br/>
To stretch out so that we could disappear<br/>
<br/>
Into the endlessness of blue<br/>
Into the horror of the truth<br/>
We are far less than we knew<br/>
Yes, we are far less than we knew<br/>

But we knew what we could taste<br/>
Girls found honey to drench our hands<br/>
Men cut marble to mark our graves<br/>
Saying that we will need something to remind us<br/>
<br/>
Of all the sweetness that has passed through us<br/>
(Fresh sangria and lemon tea)<br/>
The priests dressed children for a choir<br/>
(White-robed small voices praise Him)<br/>
<br/>
But found no joy in what was sung<br/>
The funeral had begun in the middle of the day<br/>
When you drive home to your place<br/>
From that job that makes you sleep<br/>
<br/>
Back to the thoughts that keep you awake<br/>
Long after night has come to claim<br/>
Any light that still remains in the corner of the frame<br/>
That you put around her face<br/>

He's been strumming and screaming all night, down there<br/>
The tape hiss will cover the words that he sings<br/>

<br/>
In a graveyard or garden that waits for the spring<br/>
To awake from its sleep and burst into green<br/>
And I've cried and you would think I would better for it<br/>
But the sadness just sleeps and it stays in your spine<br/>
<br/>
For the rest of your life<br/>
And I've learned and you'd think I'd be something more now<br/>
But it just goes to show it is not what you know<br/>
It's what you were thinking at the time.<br/>
<br/>
This feeling's familiar, I've been here before<br/>
In a kitchen this quiet I waited for a sign or just something<br/>
That might reassure me of anything close to meaning or motion<br/>
(With a reason to move)<br/>
<br/>
I need something I want to be close to<br/>
And I scream, but I still don't know why I do it<br/>

						Now that it's June, we'll sleep out in the garden<br/>
And if it rains, we'll just sink in to the mud<br/>
Where it is quiet and much cooler than the house is<br/>
And there is no clocks or phones to wake us up<br/>
<br/>
Because I have learned that nothing is as pressing<br/>
As the one who is pressing would like you to believe<br/>
And I am content to walk a little slower<br/>
Because there is nowhere that I really need to be<br/>
<br/>
I find that life is easier when it is just a blur<br/>
With no details to confuse who or what or where I was<br/>
So when the ending comes the full regret will be obscure<br/>
But these are days we dream about when the sunlight paints us gold<br/>
<br/>
And this apartment could not be prettier as when we danced<br/>
up there alone<br/>
This TV is old, the color is fucked, do you see the difference in the shades?<br/>
But the green is still close to green, my love<br/>
<br/>
And I believe we are the same<br/>
And we'll stay like this, all gold and green<br/>
The light collects and projects your heart on a movie screen<br/>
And if you close your eyes<br/>
<br/>
We will always be the way we were that night<br/>
You crawled inside of me<br/>
And you slept in my blood the way you sleep now<br/>
The quietest hush has consumed this house<br/>
<br/>
And when the doctors are gone and you sweat through the bed<br/>
With all these pictures and pills they piled around your head<br/>
Just rest now, and in a moment you will know everything<br/>
Was it just a dream?<br/>
<br/>
It's too vague now to recount<br/>
And outline of the one you loved in a life that was not longer<br/>
Will be standing above you as you sleep<br/><br/><br/> </div>"

You say there are days longer than nights<br/>
And I could be happy if only I'd try, but I don't try<br/>
I don't try<br/>

As you explain to your mother how you have wanted to die<br/>
So she kisses your fingers and says, ""My darling, but why?  <br/>
When there is so much more, there is so much more<br/>
Do you know there are spaces open and wide?<br/>

The bold and yellow daylight grows<br/>
Like ivy across the wall<br/>
And bounces off of the painted porcelain<br/>
Tiny dancing doll<br/>
Her body spins as she pirouettes again<br/>
The world suddenly seems small<br/>
<br/>
On an off white subtle morning<br/>
You stretch your legs in the front seat<br/>
The road has made a vacuum where our voices used to be<br/>
And you lay your head onto my shoulder<br/>
Pour like water over me<br/>
So if I just exist for the next ten minutes of this drive<br/>
That would be fine<br/>
And all the trees that line this curb<br/>
Would be rejoicing and alive<br/>

Makes fountains of your eyes<br/>

Waving you goodbye<br/><br/><br/> </div>"

Nowhere is sky, it's just that black, black dirt<br/>
Expanding outwards, just echoes for answers <br/>
Not that it matters if it's back or it's forwards<br/>
Unhappy lovers with baskets of flowers <br/>
Use them as markers<br/>
The place where your bed once stood <br/>
A time when it still felt good<br/>

And they'll believe that they knew me<br/>
And loved me and missed me, and all call me by my name<br/>
<br/>
So imagine what you want<br/>
And then hold on to that thought<br/>
'Cause that's as close as it will ever come<br/>
<br/>
And believe you're where you are<br/>
Keep acting out the part<br/>
But at the end of the day, the trees all get wheeled away<br/>
And you'll be standing alone in a blank, blank space<br/>
<br/>
So believe you're who you are and stay in character<br/>
But at the end of the play, the audience walks away<br/>
And I'll be shivering cold on a well lit stage<br/>

						I loved a triple spiral<br/>
My maiden mother crow<br/>
I folded my devotion to an origami rose<br/>
So out her ten feet window, she said to look below<br/>
Could I see the town was burning?<br/>
Could I see the broken prison?<br/>
Could I see that it was time for me to go?<br/>
<br/>
They looted the museum,<br/>
Took all that they could hold<br/>
A motorcade of flatbed trucks<br/>
Made off with with quite a haul<br/>
And that's when I heard someone shout<br/>
""In with new, out with the old!""<br/>
A dusty box of letters<br/>
A rusty suit of armor<br/>
A casket made of 14 carat gold<br/>
<br/>
That's the problem<br/>
No sense of time<br/>
She changes like an hourglass<br/>
They're playing on the side<br/>
<br/>
I loved you triple spiral<br/>
Father, son, and ghost<br/>
But you left me in my darkest hour<br/>
When I needed you, when I needed you<br/>
Now that the dream is over, I want it to be known<br/>
I never saw you coming<br/>
From my little human prism<br/>
How sad it is to know I'm in control<br/>
<br/>
That's the problem, an empty sky<br/>
I fill it up with everything that's missing from my life<br/>
Where'd you come from, you faded sign?<br/>
Spinning through the centuries<br/>
Expanding all the time<br/>
<br/>
Three worlds at once that blend together<br/>
Three times I cried for us<br/>
But I felt better then <br/>
<br/>
I loved you triple spiral<br/>
My maiden mother crow<br/>
You found me in this fallowed state<br/>
My mind was off and stow<br/>
I heard your strange commotion<br/>
And wished I could go home<br/>
To live a little longer<br/>
A full Indian summer<br/>
Long enough to carve you into stone<br/><br/><br/> </div>"

						I am a blueblood I will admit that. I dance in blue shoes and wear a blue hat. Live in a blue house on a blue street, in a blue town by a blue creek. I write my blue songs with m blue pen. I sing the blue notes to my blue friends. Now I don't know that much about you but I like you because you are true blue.<br/>
<br/>
I had a blue dream about a blue star. In it I drove there in a blue car. And when I got there I met a blue dog with a blue tongue, we had real fun. We bounced a blue ball. It broke a blue glass. We banged on blue drums and called it bluegrass. I guess the thing I'm trying to tell you is that it is best kid if you're true blue.<br/>
<br/>
Once I had gangrene. I had it real bad. And so the Doc came with his black bag. I said ""You know doc, I don't feel well. If you had a blue bag I think I'd get well."" So he came right back with a blue sack. He said ""Will this do?"" I said, ""Why not? Yeah.""<br/>
That is how I am here today to tell you that it is best man to be true blue. <br/>
<br/>
Out on the blue sea I sailed a blue ship. I had a first mate that always had blue lips. His name was Bluebeard. He had a weird twitch. We flew a blue flag up on a big stick. And we ate bluegill and we ate blue chips. Oh, I felt real blue eating that blue fish. Because there ain't much that I won't do unless it keeps me from being true blue. <br/>
<br/>
Once in a blue moon there is a blue sky. I wear blue jeans and fly my blue kite. It hangs like a bluebird until the wind dies and then the tears pour out of my blue eyes. If it is your birthday we'll bake a blue cake and then we'll eat it off my blue plates. Because kid I don't know much about you but I like you because you're true blue.<br/><br/><br/> </div>"

						Lovers turn into monsters at the loss of all affection<br/>
Almost like it was the affection that kept them from being monsters<br/>
And I could have used some warning<br/>
I was on that porch all morning<br/>
Smoking cigarettes and sinking deeper into doubt<br/>
Could it be I am mistaken, have I stolen somebody’s baby?<br/>
Is it possible for two people to need the same thing?<br/>
It's just the lines, they get so blurry<br/>
Between what is once, and now required<br/>
And I don't know on which side his heart falls<br/>
But I know where mine is buried<br/>
And it's so far from any wanting<br/>
Yeah, it needs this to keep beating<br/>
It won't go on without it<br/>
If I'm still weighed down with subtleties<br/>
Then I'll just come right out and say<br/>
That I think that I deserve her<br/>
More than anyone deserves anything<br/>
Maybe I am selfish, but there is no way to share this<br/>
There’s not enough to go around, I don’t care who else gets hurt<br/>
But I’m still sick with empathy because I was stood in his place<br/>
I spent a year quietly dying while you let go and ignored her<br/>
And I’m sure that there are reasons for everything that happens<br/>
And absence leads to adoration, yeah it’s nobody’s fault<br/>
But now there is no way to change this<br/>
So I just photographed and framed it<br/>
And it’s hanging in a hallway<br/>
That we have no right to walk back down<br/>
But I hope that he feels better but I’m sick of all the drama<br/>
I can’t stand to see her crying, I just want this shit to end<br/>
And I want a place to hang out where a record player’s playing<br/>
And there’s a thousand movies rented for a thousand nights with her<br/><br/><br/> </div>"

						I have a friend, he's mostly made of pain<br/>
He wakes up, drives to work and straight back home again<br/>
He once cut one of my nightmares out of paper<br/>
I thought it was beautiful, I put it on a record cover<br/>
And I tried to tell him that he had a sense<br/>
Of color and composition so magnificent<br/>
And he said thank you, please, but your flattery<br/>
It is truly not becoming me<br/>
Your eyes are poor, you're blind, you see<br/>
No beauty ever could have come from me<br/>
I'm a waste<br/>
Of breath, of space, of time<br/>
<br/>
I knew a woman she was dignified and true<br/>
Her love for her man was one of her many virtues<br/>
Until one day she found out that he had lied<br/>
And decided the rest of her life from that point on would be a lie<br/>
She was grateful for everything that had happened<br/>
And she was anxious for all that would come next<br/>
But then she wept, what did you expect<br/>
In that big old house with the cars she kept<br/>
Such is life, she often said<br/>
With one day leading to the next<br/>
You get a little closer to your death<br/>
Which was fine with her, she never got upset<br/>
And with all the days she may have left<br/>
She would never clean another mess <br/>
Or fold his shirts, or look her best <br/>
She was free<br/>
To waste away alone<br/>
<br/>
Last night my brother, he got drunk and drove<br/>
And this cop, he pulled him off to the side of the road<br/>
And he said officer, officer, you've got the wrong man<br/>
No, no, I'm a student of medicine, a son of a banker, you don't understand<br/>
The cop said No one got hurt, you should be thankful<br/>
And your carelessness, it is something awful<br/>
And no I can't just let you go<br/>
And though your father's name is known<br/>
Your decisions now are yours alone <br/>
You're nothing but a stepping stone on a path<br/>
To debt, to loss, to shame<br/>
<br/>
The last few months I've been living with this couple<br/>
Yeah, you know the kind who buy everything in doubles<br/>
Yeah, they fit together like a puzzle<br/>
I love their love and I am thankful<br/>
That someone actually receives the prize that was promised<br/>
By all those fairy tales that drugged us<br/>
And still to me I'm sick, lonely<br/>
No laurel tree, just green envy<br/>
Will my number come up eventually<br/>
Like love's some kind of lottery<br/>
Where you scratch and see what's underneath<br/>
It's sorry<br/>
Just one cherry<br/>
I'll play again, get lucky<br/>
<br/>
So now I hang out down by the train's depot<br/>
No, I don't ride, I just sit and watch the people there<br/>
They remind me of wind-up cars in motion<br/>
They way they spin and turn and jockey for positions<br/>
And I want to scream out that it all is nonsense<br/>
Their life's one track and can't they see it's pointless? <br/>
But just then my knees give under me<br/>
My head feels weak and suddenly <br/>
It's clear to see, it's not them, but me<br/>
Who's lost my self-identity<br/>
And I hide behind these books I read<br/>
While scribbling my poetry <br/>
Like art could save a wretch like me <br/>
With some ideal ideology<br/>
That no one could hope to achieve<br/>
And I'm never real, it's just a sketch of me <br/>
And everything I've made is trite and cheap and a waste<br/>
Of paint<br/>
Of tape<br/>
Of time<br/>
<br/>
So I park my car down by the cathedral<br/>
Where the floodlights point up at the steeples<br/>
Choir practice is filling up with people<br/>
I hear the sound escaping as an echo<br/>
Sloping off the ceiling at an angle<br/>
When the voices blend they sound like angels<br/>
I hope there's some room still in the middle<br/>
But when lift my voice up now to reach them<br/>
The range is too high way up in heaven<br/>
So I hold my tongue, forget the song <br/>
Tie my shoes, start walking off <br/>
And try to just keep moving on<br/>
With my broken heart and my absent god<br/>
And I have no faith but it's all I want<br/>
To be loved<br/>
And believe<br/>
In my soul, in my soul<br/><br/><br/> </div>"

That's time spent better sleeping in your bed<br/>

Yeah, anything to entertain yourself<br/>
Because a costume can be comfortable<br/>
It can make you feel more beautiful<br/>
It can even make you look like someone else<br/>
But it's still you, so there's nothing you can do<br/>
Like a bad habit, the one you couldn't kick, there it always is<br/>
And it's nothing that no doctor's going to fix<br/>
<br/>
They pat your back bruised with their accolades<br/>
And all four walls are a trophy case<br/>
But that doesn't make it any less of a cage<br/>
But you can make it all less difficult<br/>

And so I say, that could change<br/>
<br/>
I noticed how you waste no time making your way across the room<br/>
You leave a wake of tongues still waving after you<br/>
And it isn't no coincidence where you finally choose to stand<br/>
I guess soon you will be leaving your man<br/>
<br/>
It's a sweet smile and then a denial<br/>
Hey, you are just trying to be nice<br/>
But there is a meaning to every fleeting action you unconsciously decide<br/>
The clocks, they chime, now it's time<br/>
<br/>
I know you try and play it cool but there are some thoughts<br/>
You just can't hide, only in your closest friends do you confide<br/>
The way you say you'll be seeing me, oh, like it's so offhand<br/>
I guess soon you will be leaving your man<br/>
<br/>
You stare at me so boldly now, you have no lack of confidence<br/>
It's just those lessons on subtlety you missed<br/>
I know you dream of saving me like I'm some plane that you could land<br/>
But when you fly you'll be leaving your man<br/>

Shared every bruise and<br/>
Showed every scar<br/>

Hope has its proof<br/>
Your hand in mine, singing<br/>
Life has a beautiful, crazy design<br/>

Forget the world and its weight<br/>
And here I just want to stay<br/>

Where you can be what you are<br/>

The whole Milky Way<br/>
In your eyes<br/>
I drifted away<br/>
And in your arms<br/>
I just want to sway<br/>

						Joseph rode in on a beam of light<br/>
Stray dogs to welcome in fights<br/>
Go build the cathedrals<br/>
The sight of the pilgrims gone nowhere<br/>
And millions of cars<br/>
They guise a dream in the distance<br/>
From promises he'd leave behind<br/>
When there was no harvest<br/>
He missed the sky and its circus<br/>
And countless, the stars<br/>
<br/>
In Africa<br/>
The rivers are perfectly deep and beautifully wide<br/>
In Africa<br/>
The mothers will sing you to sleep<br/>
Say it's alright, child, it's alright<br/>
<br/>
In Africa<br/>
We dance in the water and hold each other so tight<br/>
In Africa<br/>
The mothers will sing you to sleep<br/>
And say it's alright, child, it's alright<br/>

Dreamed of his queen by his side<br/>
There will be a beautiful sunset<br/>

God is watching me<br/>
God don’t praise me because I beat Joe Frazier<br/>
God don’t give nothing about Joe Frazier<br/>
God don’t care nothing about England or America <br/>
As far as real wealth… it’s all His.<br/>
He wants to know how do we treat each other?<br/>
How do we help each other?<br/>
So I’m going to dedicate my life to using my name and popularity <br/>
To helping charities, helping people, uniting people, <br/>
People bombing each other because of religious beliefs. <br/>
We need somebody in the world to help us all make peace.<br/>
So when I die – if there’s a heaven – I’m gonna see it.<br/><br/><br/> </div>"

Where do you think you're going so fast<br/>

It's a case of cruel to be kind<br/>

Over the hills and horizon<br/>

Prove it to them or you prove it to yourself but honestly it's better if you do it for yourself<br/>

Baltimore at night<br/>

Seas would rise when I gave the word<br/>
Now in the morning, I sleep alone<br/>
Sweep the streets I used to own<br/>

I used to roll the dice<br/>
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes<br/>
Listen as the crowd would sing<br/>
Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!<br/>

Next the walls were closed on me<br/>
And I discovered that my castles stand<br/>
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand<br/>

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing<br/>
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing<br/>
Be my mirror, my sword and shield<br/>
My missionaries in a foreign field<br/>
For some reason I can't explain<br/>
Once you go there was never, never a honest word<br/>
And that was when I ruled the world<br/>
<br/>
It was a wicked and wild wind<br/>
Blew down the doors to let me in<br/>
Shattered windows and the sound of drums<br/>
People couldn't believe what I'd become<br/>

Revolutionaries wait<br/>
For my head on a silver plate<br/>
Just a puppet on a lonely string<br/>

You were rubbing both of my hands<br/>
Chewing on a candy bar<br/>

To be showing up like this""<br/>

Storing up the clues<br/>
It had its sullen blue bruised through by showing<br/>
Settle past a patience<br/>
Where wishes and your will are spilling pictures<br/>
Water's running through<br/>
In the valley where we grew to write this this scripture<br/>
<br/>
Never gonna break, never gonna break<br/>
Never gonna break, never gonna break<br/>
Not for a part in any gamut of the dark<br/>
<br/>
Doubled in the toes<br/>
Annex it, it minute closed in the morning<br/>
Did not lose it in the stack's stow<br/>
I'ma lay that call back on you<br/>
You know it won't beseech you<br/>
We're laying in an open field<br/>
I will let you grow<br/>
No need to know this<br/>
So carry on, my dear<br/>
What is clear up in the daylight is we're hung here<br/>
Fall is coming soon<br/>
A new year for the moon and the Hmong here<br/>
<br/>
Never gonna break, never gonna break<br/>
Never gonna break, never gonna break<br/>
All that it seems<br/>
Bellows tracing through the streams<br/>
Never gonna break, never gonna break<br/>
Never gonna break, never gonna break<br/>
All at its seams<br/>
Swallows swelling for the beams<br/><br/><br/> </div>"

						from the moment the arms of the midwestern sky <br/>
broke down to the pavement <br/>
in a vehicle ragged returning<br/>
nervously brave, making my way to you<br/>

heaters have broken, it's cold every day<br/>
in the mysteries at the top of my mind<br/>
I've never reached an answer, I'm only given clues<br/>

I ain't got a whole lot of things on my list<br/>

I've got you on my mindï»¿ and nothing to lose<br/>
nothing better than a journey to you<br/>
<br/>
in the thick of the night my stomach is sore<br/>
I think I'm unable to carry on<br/>
as the lighthouse gets smaller I'm closer to torn<br/>
nothing better on a journey to you<br/>
<br/>
and sometimes I may stumble<br/>
and sometimes I wonder what love is<br/>
and I wonder what it's like<br/>
to hold true, so close to you<br/>
<br/>
I might be wrong, but Mary I need to get to you<br/>
I know I have hours to go<br/>
I justï»¿ said I'd be back and watch the sky blue<br/>
nothing better than a journey to you<br/>

I want to grow old with you, no matter how long it takes<br/>

always setting in the motion, I know<br/>
nothing better that a journey to you<br/>
<br/>
from the dark desert highway<br/>
to the mountains of Colorado<br/>
keep a candle burning at the back of my eyes<br/>
of you sleeping, ceasing<br/>
<br/>
my words bleed from this guitar like you hear someone speak<br/>
like an oak to the wind in the trees<br/>
I know you're for sure with me but Iï»¿ still feel like saying<br/>
thank you and please<br/>
<br/>
and every time you sneeze as a wise man once said<br/>
I believe in love<br/>
when the breast of the hills meets the color of the sea<br/>
like your soft cheeks meet the blue eyes looking at me<br/>
<br/>
it's amazing trying to put into words the message coming truly in song<br/>
like one I amï»¿ simple, our brains too big to use<br/>
nothing better than a journey to you<br/>
<br/>
I won't be quoting some book to conclude in some proof<br/>
we're only 99 percent soulmates anyway<br/>
but to see the smallest tree and the amount that it grew<br/>
at the end of a journey, there's you<br/>

They said ""we're on your side,<br/>

He lets all believers in through the forgiveness of sin“<br/>

When they hurt me they whispered that the gays had to pay<br/>
When they beat me all of my worth was taken away<br/>

""Son there's just principles, I cannot be the one who helps you“<br/>

Father your cold heart’s a smoking gun<br/>
Your cross ain’t no where I want to hang my hope from<br/>

You warned you would find bleeding<br/>
A crease in my long back<br/>
This is long before you knew me<br/>
I was a slave to hearts attack<br/>
You need it like a train track needs its pins and spikes<br/>
And the town below the damn falls needs its gutter and it’s dice<br/>
Sweet sweet Magdalene<br/>
Build your time machine<br/>
I’m sturdy like the sewer lines<br/>
But I’m one dead Nazarene<br/>
Come invade my prison<br/>
Come up to my cell<br/>
Oh, What the hell we’ll stay a spell tonight babe<br/>

Of all these empty promises and countless bluffs.<br/>

Everyone that I ever knew was crammed into a little building with a hardwood floor<br/>

And friends were choking back the tears that they had come there for<br/>
And I was in a little jar upon the stage<br/>
Where all my records and guitars were neatly placed<br/>

Left of the tables of food sat two girls I could not recall speaking to<br/>
And one told the other<br/>
""Don't cry, we still have three of the others, it will be all right""<br/>
And I was hovering overhead taking it in<br/>
But all the things I should of said they were trapped forever in my skin<br/>

And there were a number of speeches where people said what they didn't want me to know<br/>
Telling all types of secrets I wish I would have known about five days ago<br/>
It would have been quite a surprise for me to look them dead in the eyes and say<br/>
<br/>
Well, it was a lovely affair, people cared more than I had ever thought they would<br/>
Some kids stole what was left of the booze<br/>

So perfectly placed below the mirror <br/>
Arriving late, you clean the debris<br/>
And walked into the angry sea;<br/>

For there are more ascensions than there is space<br/>

Choppers hovering like vultures above a meal<br/>

In the waters where we used to swim<br/>
Where we thought we would be young forever<br/>
But beads that glisten on your sunburnt skin<br/>
Evaporated in the flames and embers<br/>

I quit sending postcards 'cause no one know what to revere,<br/>
And the mailman can't come in to explain<br/>
<br/>
So I'm out of gasoline, and I hate see, and it's hard to never mind.<br/>
It's hard to never mind.<br/>

I bought myself new candles, they only burn old flames.<br/>
I guess it's all the same anyway<br/>

Looked through my high school annuals to see who I still knew<br/>
But my point of view's forever changed<br/>
<br/>
All this gasoline just goes to show that no one never minds.<br/>
It's building up, bottled up in time<br/>
<br/>
All your energy just says to me that you never can't unwind.<br/>
Just bring it down, bring it down this time.<br/>
<br/>
And should it count against me, if I keep everything that you send me?<br/>
Are you going to find me so the bogs? aren't empty all the time?<br/>
<br/>
I think way too much about the way things should be said<br/>
Cause it just can't leave my head all the way.<br/>
<br/>
It seems my brand new candles would catch on fire today<br/>
I think I might get burned anyway<br/>
<br/>
All this gasoline just goes to show not everything is nice.<br/>
I do my best, I know not everything is right<br/>
<br/>
All your energy just says to me that you never can't unwind.<br/>
Just bring it down, bring it down this time.<br/>
Please bring it down, bring it down.<br/><br/><br/> </div>"

						Last night I dreamt that I was you<br/>
I was dressed all in black with dark glasses and attitude<br/>
Such a pose I could simply not hold <br/>
Through days in a northern town that I had once called a home<br/>
And your studies of fringe New York Streets<br/>
I was reading the pavement in every word you would speak<br/>
To a brownstone up three flights of stairs and it's on<br/>
<br/>
Buying drinks for the poets upstate<br/>
The southern corruption tows you down the interstate<br/>
And they all said that you were the king <br/>
Of a gloomy disruption that surfaced when you would sing<br/>
And this town simply cannot begin to compete <br/>
So I'm packing my Bullets and Silvertones and heading east <br/>
To a brownstone up three flights of stairs and it's on, on, on, on, it's<br/>
<br/>
I could have had my way, this year would bridge '66 again<br/>
<br/>
Trust fund hipsters were casing the room <br/>
Chock-full of amphetamines<br/>
The overturned kick drum boom <br/>
Set the pace with incomparable cool<br/>
And if the tempo was lousy it was lost on all but you <br/>
And your studies of fringe New York Streets<br/>
I was reading the pavement in every word you would speak<br/>
To a brownstone up three flights of stairs and it's on, on, on, on, it's<br/>

Reeling bodies failing to discover<br/>

Raising their voices to convince one another<br/>

Where the rows of teeth they grow in fields of infinite greed<br/>

Where the road meets the horizon for everyone<br/>
For everyone<br/>

Waking up to the sound of 5 A.M. to take my turn at the wheel. <br/>

Vision tunneled, Mission Street, hunger beat <br/>
Lodged out as the engine wheezed. <br/>
Still moving regardless of stable ground <br/>

Ever fearful of the answer<br/>
When the candle in the tunnel<br/>
Is flickering and sputters<br/>

It's only then that you will know<br/>
What lies above or down below<br/>
Or if these fictions only prove<br/>
How much you've really got to lose<br/>

There is stained glass<br/>
There's a steeple that is reaching<br/>
Up towards the heavens<br/>
Such ambition never failing to amaze me<br/>
It's either quite a master plan<br/>
Or just chemicals that help us understand<br/>
That when our hearts stop ticking<br/>
This is the end<br/>
And there's nothing past this<br/>

As if you won't sleep again <br/>

You fix your hair and tie your shoes <br/>
And tuck your shirt and now you feel new <br/>

And every day dissolves and there's no hope <br/>

Of ever leaving this temporary life <br/>

That there's no beep before the dial tone <br/>

If there is, its probably your Mom <br/>

Oh the rising sun brings little change <br/>
To this city with a stolen name <br/>
And you're wondering who's bright idea <br/>
It was to pack your things and leave your friends and move Down here<br/><br/><br/> </div>"

Yeah, she is beautiful, but she don't mean a thing to me.<br/>

The California sun cascading down my face<br/>
There was a girl with light brown streaks<br/>
And she was beautiful but she didn't mean a thing to me.<br/>

Wanted to believe in all the words that I was speaking<br/>

And all the playful misspellings.<br/>
And every bite I gave you left a mark.<br/>

Tiny vessels oozed into your neck<br/>
And formed the bruises,<br/>
That you said you didn't want to fade,<br/>
But they did and so did I that day.<br/>

All I see are dark grey clouds<br/>
In the distance moving closer with every hour.<br/>

No, we can't talk about it now.""<br/>

So one last touch and then you'll go.<br/>
And we'll pretend that it meant something so much more,<br/>

Until the engine kicks and sputters<br/>
Until we roll the rubber off the tires<br/>
Know I'll always need you by my side<br/>

						I'm in Los Angeles today, it smells like an airport runway. jet fuel stenches<br/>
In the cabin and lights flickering at random.<br/>
<br/>
I'm in Los Angeles today, garbage cans comprise the medians of freeways always<br/>
Creeping even when the population's sleeping.<br/>
<br/>
And I can't see why you'd want to live here.<br/>
<br/>
I'm in Los Angeles today, asked a gas station employee if he ever had trouble<br/>
Breathing and he said ""it varies from season to season, kid.""<br/>
<br/>
It's where our best are on display: motion picture actors' houses maps are never<br/>
Ever current so save your film and $15.<br/>
<br/>
And I can't see why you'd want to live here.<br/>
Billboards reach past the tallest buildings,<br/>
""we are not perfect but we sure try.""<br/>
As UV rays ""degradate"" our youth with time.<br/>
<br/>
The vessel keeps pumping us through this entropic place in the belly of the<br/>
Beast that is californ-I-A, I drank from a faucet and I kept my receipts for<br/>
When the weigh me on my way out (here nothing is free).<br/>
The greyhounds keep coming dumping locusts into the street until the gutters<br/>
Overflow and Los Angeles thinks, ""I might explode someday soon.""<br/>
<br/>
It's a lovely summer's day and I can almost see a skyline through a thickening<br/>
Shroud of egos. (is this the city of angeles or demons?)<br/>
Here the names are what remain: stars encapsulate the gold lame and they need<br/>
Constant cleaning for when the tourists begin salivating.<br/>
<br/>
You can't swim in a town this shallow - you will most assuredly drown tomorrow.<br/><br/><br/> </div>"

Dragged a comb across my head<br/>
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup<br/>

Found my coat and grabbed my hat<br/>
Made the bus in seconds flat<br/>
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke<br/>
And somebody spoke and I went into a dream<br/>

It's not too far back on the highway <br/>
Not too long a ride<br/>
You take your car along <br/>
And you park it outside <br/>
A little cutie takes your hat <br/>
And you can thank her, ma'am<br/>
'Cause every time you're gonna drive <br/>
You find the joint is jammed<br/>

Oh Carol, don't let him <br/>
Steal your heart away<br/>
Well I've got to learn to dance <br/>
If it takes me all night and day Auw<br/>

Well if you want to hear some music <br/>
Like the boys all play<br/>
Hold tight, tap your foot<br/>
Don't let it carry you away<br/>
Don't let the heat overcome you <br/>
'Cause they play so loud <br/>
While the music will treat you <br/>
When they get a crowd<br/>
Well you can dance <br/>
I know you will, you thought<br/>
I got my eyes on you baby<br/>
'Cause you dance so good<br/>

When you'll say, ""Mm you're my little girl""<br/>

It's not the first time that it's happened to me,<br/>
It's been a long lonely time<br/>
And it's funny funny to see that I'm about to lose my mind mind mind<br/>

So I hope there'll come a day<br/>
When you say, ""Mm mm<br/>

And soon Miss Fanny Bright, was seated by my side <br/>
The horse was lean and lank, misfortune seemed his lot <br/>
He got into a drifted bank and we got upsot <br/>
<br/>
[Chorus:]<br/>

A day or two ago, the story I must tell <br/>
I went out on the snow, and on my back I fell<br/>
A gent was riding by, in a one-horse open sleigh <br/>
He laughed as there I sprawling lie but quickly drove away <br/>
<br/>
[Chorus:]<br/>
<br/>
Now the ground is white, go it while you're young <br/>
Take the girls tonight, and sing this sleighing song<br/>

Hitch him to an open sleigh and crack! you'll take the lead <br/>

Made of clay and wood<br/>
Where lives a young country boy<br/>
Named Johnny B. Goode<br/>

To read or write a book so well<br/>
But he could play his guitar<br/>
Just like a-ringing a bell<br/>

In a gunny sack<br/>
Sit beneath the trees<br/>
By the railroad track<br/>
Oh sitting and a-playing<br/>
In the shade<br/>
Drumming to the rhythm<br/>
That the drivers made<br/>
People passing by<br/>
Used to stop and say<br/>
My oh my<br/>
That country boy can play<br/>

Go go, go Johnny go go go!<br/>

Someday you will be a man<br/>
And you will be the leader<br/>
Of a big old band<br/>
Many people coming<br/>
From miles around<br/>
To hear you play your music<br/>
Till the sun goes down<br/>
Maybe some day<br/>
Your name will be in light<br/>
Saying Johnny B. Goode tonight!<br/>

Painting testimonial pictures<br/>
Oh, oh, oh, oh<br/>

Rose and Valerie, screaming from the gallery<br/>
Say he must go free<br/>

The judge does not agree and he tells them<br/>

There lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon<br/>
And one day his woman ran off with another guy<br/>
Hit young Rocky in the eye<br/>
Rocky didn't like that<br/>
He said, ""I'm gonna get that boy""<br/>
So one day he walked into town<br/>
Booked himself a room in the local saloon<br/>
<br/>
Rocky Raccoon checked into his room<br/>
Only to find Gideon's Bible<br/>
Rocky had come, equipped with a gun<br/>
To shoot off the legs of his rival<br/>
His rival it seems, had broken his dreams<br/>
By stealing the girl of his fancy<br/>
Her name was Magill, and she called herself Lil<br/>
But everyone knew her as Nancy<br/>
Now she and her man, who called himself Dan<br/>
Were in the next room at the hoe down<br/>
Rocky burst in, and grinning a grin<br/>
He said, ""Danny boy, this is a showdown""<br/>
But Daniel was hot, he drew first and shot<br/>
And Rocky collapsed in the corner<br/>
<br/>
Now the doctor came in, stinking of gin<br/>
And proceeded to lie on the table<br/>
He said, ""Rocky, you met your match""<br/>
And Rocky said, ""Doc, it's only a scratch<br/>
And I'll be better, I'll be better, Doc, as soon as I am able""<br/>
<br/>
Now Rocky Raccoon, he fell back in his room<br/>
Only to find Gideon's Bible<br/>
Gideon checked out, and he left it, no doubt<br/>
To help with good Rocky's revival<br/><br/><br/> </div>"

						Wednesday morning at five o'clock<br/>
As the day begins<br/>
Silently closing her bedroom door<br/>
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more<br/>
<br/>
She goes downstairs to the kitchen<br/>
Clutching her handkerchief<br/>
Quietly turning the backdoor key<br/>
Stepping outside, she is free<br/>
<br/>
She(we gave her most of our lives)<br/>
Is leaving (sacrificed most of our lives)<br/>
Home (we gave her everything money could buy)<br/>
She's leaving home, after living alone, for so many years (bye bye)<br/>
<br/>
Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown<br/>
Picks up the letter that's lying there<br/>
Standing alone at the top of the stairs<br/>
She breaks down and cries to her husband<br/>
""Daddy, our baby's gone.<br/>
""Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly?<br/>
How could she do this to me?""<br/>
<br/>
She (we never thought of ourselves)<br/>
Is leaving (never a thought for ourselves)<br/>
Home (we struggled hard all our lives to get by)<br/>
She's leaving home, after living alone, for so many years<br/>
<br/>
Friday morning, at nine o'clock<br/>
She is far away<br/>
Waiting to keep the appointment she made<br/>
Meeting a man from the Motortrade<br/>
<br/>
She (what did we do that was wrong)<br/>
Is Having (we didn't know it was wrong)<br/>
Fun (fun is the one thing that money can't buy)<br/>
<br/>
Something inside, that was always denied, for so many years<br/>
She's leaving home, bye, bye<br/><br/><br/> </div>"

						Standing in the dock at Southampton<br/>
Trying to get to Holland or France<br/>
The man in the mac said<br/>
You've got to go back<br/>
You know they didn't even give us a chance<br/>
<br/>
Christ you know it ain't easy<br/>
You know how hard it can be<br/>
The way things are going<br/>
They're going to crucify me<br/>
<br/>
Finally made the plane into Paris<br/>
Honeymooning down by the Seine<br/>
Peter Brown call to say<br/>
You can make it O.K.<br/>
You can get married in Gibraltar near Spain<br/>
<br/>
Christ you know it ain't easy<br/>
You know how hard it can be<br/>
The way things are going<br/>
They're going to crucify me<br/>
<br/>
Drove from Paris to the Amsterdam Hilton<br/>
Talking in our beds for a week<br/>
The newspapers said<br/>
Say what're you doing in bed<br/>
I said we're only trying to get us some peace<br/>
<br/>
Christ you know it ain't easy<br/>
You know how hard it can be<br/>
The way things are going<br/>
They're going to crucify me<br/>
<br/>
Saving up your money for a rainy day<br/>
Giving all your clothes to charity<br/>
Last night the wife said<br/>
Oh boy when you're dead<br/>
You don't take nothing with you but your soul, think<br/>
<br/>
Made a lightning trip to Vienna<br/>
Eating chocolate cake in a bag<br/>
The newspapers said<br/>
She's gone to his head<br/>
They look just like two gurus in drag<br/>
<br/>
Christ you know it ain't easy<br/>
You know how hard it can be<br/>
The way things are going<br/>
They're going to crucify me<br/>
<br/>
Caught the early plane back to London<br/>
Fifty acorns tied in a sack<br/>
The men from the press<br/>
Said we wish you success<br/>
It's good to have the both of you back<br/>
<br/>
Christ you know it ain't easy<br/>
You know how hard it can be<br/>
The way things are going<br/>
They're going to crucify me<br/>
The way things are going<br/>
They're going to crucify me<br/><br/><br/> </div>"

You can knit a sweater by the fireside<br/>

						The young man stands on the edge of his porch<br/>
The days were short and the father was gone<br/>
There was no one in the town and no one in the field<br/>
This dusty barren land had given all it could yield<br/>
<br/>
I've been kicked off my land at the age of sixteen<br/>
And I have no idea where else my heart could have been<br/>
I placed all my trust at the foot of this hill<br/>
And now I am sure my heart can never be still<br/>
So collect your courage and collect your horse<br/>
And pray you never feel this same kind of remorse<br/>
<br/>
Seal my heart and break my pride<br/>
I've nowhere to stand and now nowhere to hide<br/>
Align my heart, my body, my mind<br/>
To face what I've done and do my time<br/>
<br/>
Well you are my accuser, now look in my face<br/>
Your oppression reeks of your greed and disgrace<br/>
So one man has and another has not<br/>
How can you love what it is you have got<br/>
When you took it all from the weak hands of the poor?<br/>
Liars and thieves you know not what is in store<br/>
<br/>
There will come a time I will look in your eye<br/>
You will pray to the God that you always denied<br/>
Then I'll go out back and I'll get my gun<br/>
I'll say, ""You haven't met me, I am the only son""<br/>
<br/>
Seal my heart and break my pride<br/>
I've nowhere to stand and now nowhere to hide<br/>
Align my heart, my body, my mind<br/>
To face what I've done and do my time<br/>
<br/>
Seal my heart and break my pride<br/>
I've nowhere to stand and now nowhere to hide<br/>
Align my heart, my body, my mind<br/>
To face what I've done and do my time<br/>
<br/>
Well yes sir, yes sir, yes it was me<br/>
I know what I've done, 'cause I know what I've seen<br/>
I went out back and I got my gun<br/>
I said, ""You haven't met me, I am the only son""<br/><br/><br/> </div>"

Lamenting the fact that he can see<br/>

L'unique défense pour s'immuniser contre le diable<br/>
Je me fous de vos diamants<br/>

Lay down your head on my sunken chest<br/>

And young love would keep us young<br/>

Open my mouth to breath some words of peace<br/>
But the silence gives nothing back to me<br/>

So I'll be a shadow of the flame<br/>
I lent down to kiss you then erased my name<br/>
And I'll be a whisper on the wind<br/>
My hands are shaking from holding so tight for so long<br/>
<br/>
The flame burnt out in our empty hands<br/>
But now I see it's got nothing to do<br/>

<br/>
So tie me to a post and block my ears<br/>
I can see widows and orphans through my tears<br/>
I know my call despite my faults<br/>
And despite my growing fears<br/>
<br/>
But I will hold on hope<br/>
And I won't let you choke<br/>
On the noose around your neck<br/>
<br/>
And I'll find strength in pain<br/>
And I will change my ways<br/>
I'll know my name as it's called again<br/>
<br/>
So come out of your cave walking on your hands<br/>
And see the world hanging upside down<br/>
You can understand dependence<br/>
When you know the maker's hand<br/>
<br/>
So make your siren's call<br/>
And sing all you want<br/>
I will not hear what you have to say<br/>
<br/>
'Cause I need freedom now<br/>
And I need to know how<br/>
To live my life as it's meant to be<br/>
<br/>
And I will hold on hope<br/>
And I won't let you choke<br/>
On the noose around your neck<br/>
<br/>
And I'll find strength in pain<br/>
And I will change my ways<br/>
I'll know my name as it's called again<br/><br/><br/> </div>"

Reserved him to more wrath, for now the thought<br/>

Torments him; round he throws his baleful eyes<br/>

Doleful shades, where peace and rest can never dwell <br/>

						You hold your truth so purely<br/>
Swerve not through the minds of men<br/>
This lie is dead<br/>
This cup of yours tastes holy<br/>
But a brush with the devil can clear your mind<br/>
Strengthen your spine<br/>
Fingers tap into what you were once<br/>
And I'm worried that I blew my only chance<br/>

Whispers in the dark<br/>
Steal a kiss and you'll break your heart<br/>
Pick up your clothes and curl your toes<br/>
Learn your lesson, lead me home<br/>
Spare my sins for the ark<br/>
I was to slow to depart<br/>
I'm a cad but I'm not that flawed<br/>
I set out to serve the Lord.<br/>
<br/>
And my heart<br/>
Was colder when you've gone<br/>
And I lost my head<br/>
But found the one that I loved<br/>
Under the sun<br/>
Under the sun<br/>

And no one is better armed<br/>
To tear me down with a sleight of the tongue<br/>

Remember spring swaps snow for leaves<br/>

Call me, call me, you could only hurt the story<br/>
Call me, call me, I'll be there to shine a light<br/>
<br/>
Machine, machines, point me to the nearest party<br/>
You'll see, you'll see, baby it's the only way<br/>
<br/>
Call me, call me, you could only<br/>
Call me, call me, I'll be there<br/>
<br/>
Machines, machines, point me to the nearest party<br/><br/><br/> </div>"

						It's in the way she often calls me out<br/>
It's in the curve of your pretty gown<br/>
You come on legs and your pantyhose<br/>
You look so precious with your bloody nose<br/>
<br/>
We gonna come together, we gonna celebrate<br/>
We gonna gather 'round, like it's your birthday<br/>
I don't wanna know, just what I'm gonna do<br/>
I don't care where your going, I'm coming along with you<br/>
<br/>
Walking her home with the grassy field<br/>
Fallin' and laughin' at the drinks we spilled<br/>
Just one of those nights that I had to share<br/>
She's in a daze, without a care<br/>
<br/>
We gonna come together, we gonna celebrate<br/>
We gonna gather 'round, like it's your birthday<br/>
I don't wanna know, just what I'm gonna do<br/>
I don't care where your going, I'm coming along with you<br/>
<br/>
We gonna come together, we gonna celebrate<br/>
We gonna gather 'round, like it's your birthday<br/>

						My cold, cold sailor heart says, ""Get on your way.""<br/>
I ain't too proud to say it but that's how I'm made<br/>
I'll be that person 'till my dying day<br/>
I try so awful hard but I can't change<br/>
<br/>
From runways to the road I ramble alone<br/>
This thumbnail sized heart is black as coal<br/>
Though beauty it still bring me to my knee<br/>
Don't waste a tear on me this my disease<br/>
<br/>
Don't leave no smell on me<br/>
Don't leave no smell on me<br/>
I've run off in your sleep<br/>
Don't leave no smell on me<br/>
<br/>
Those preppy boys in blue they're making fun of us<br/>
So we take it to the street 'cause we're an ornery cuss<br/>
But we're not here to make your children bleed<br/>
We're here to come around with the tumbleweed<br/>
<br/>
Don't leave no smell on me<br/>
Don't leave no smell on me<br/>
I've run up in your sleeve<br/>
Don't leave no smell on me<br/>
<br/>
Now guitar, go get her<br/>
<br/>
Don't take these boots off me when you thinking I'm dead<br/>
I'll still be running from the demon in my head<br/>
I'll be that person 'till my dying day<br/>
I try so awful hard but I can't change<br/>
<br/>
Don't leave no smell on me<br/>
Don't leave no smell on me<br/>
I know I'm up your sleeve<br/>
Don't leave no smell on me<br/>
<br/>
Don't leave no, no smell<br/><br/><br/> </div>"

						Little Mona Lisa laying by my side<br/>
""Crimson and Clover"" pullin' overtime<br/>
I feel too close to be losin' touch<br/>
By givin' in, what am I givin' up<br/>
Am I losin' way too much<br/>
<br/>
Hey<br/>
California waiting<br/>
Every little thing's gotta be just right<br/>
Say<br/>
While you're tryin' to save me<br/>
Can't I get back my lonely life<br/>
<br/>
I'm goin' so fast that I can't slow down<br/>
It's hard to get up when you're spinnin' round and round<br/>
I'd give you the the news but nothin's changed<br/>
I'd sing you a song but they blew it away<br/>
All wrapped up in this stupid ass game<br/>
<br/>
Hey<br/>
California waiting<br/>
Every little thing's gotta be just right<br/>
Say<br/>
While you're tryin' to save me<br/>
Can't I get back my lonely life<br/>
