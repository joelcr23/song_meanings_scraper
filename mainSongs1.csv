						Bent at the knee, a last resort<br/>
Backfired and made things worse<br/>
Once on the bus, it was quite possible<br/>
You'd be the jailhouse queen<br/>
Jury and judge were screaming to hang<br/>
You spat the sweat from brow<br/>
He shrugged his shoulders, nothing would work<br/>
It had to end right now<br/>

I can't drive straight counting your fake frowns<br/>
Focusing in, details a must<br/>
Trying to make each one count<br/>
All on your fingers stopping at ten<br/>
Magistrate's keyed in how<br/>
The jury and judge were screaming to hang<br/>
You spat the sweat from brow<br/>
He shrugged his shoulders, nothing would work<br/>
It had to end right now<br/>

Don't you know the air's so thin?<br/>

I know it's such a dangerous place<br/>
For there are more ascensions than there is space<br/>
Angels causing accidents<br/>

But if I start to levitate<br/>
Pull me down with all your weight<br/>

And the grapevines seemed left for dead.<br/>
And the northern sky, looked like the end of day,<br/>

The wake up call to a rented room<br/>
Sounded like an alarm of impending doom.<br/>
To warn us it's only a matter of time.<br/>
Before we all burn<br/>
Before we all burn<br/>
Before we all burn<br/>
Before we all burn.<br/>

Near your daughter's school when we picked her up<br/>
And drove to a cemetery on a hill,<br/>
On a hill.<br/>
<br/>
Watched the plumes paint the sky gray<br/>
As she laughed and danced through the field of graves<br/>
There I knew it would be alright<br/>
That everything would be alright,<br/>
Would be alright<br/>
Would be alright<br/>
Would be alright<br/>
Would be alright.<br/>
<br/>
And the news reports on the radio<br/>
Said it was getting worse<br/>
As the ocean air fanned the flames.<br/>
But I couldn't think of anywhere I would have rather been<br/>
To watch it all burn away,<br/>
To burn away.<br/>

The firemen worked in double shifts,<br/>
With prayers for rain on their lips,<br/>
And they knew it was only a matter of time.<br/><br/><br/> </div>"

You wanted me to write you letters, but I'd rather lose your address<br/>

Sitting in the station, it's all a blur<br/>
Of dancehall hips, pretentious quips. <br/>
A boxers, bob and weave. <br/>

And here's the kicker of this whole shebang<br/>
You're in debt and completely fooled, <br/>
That you can look into the mirror and objectively rank your wounds.<br/>
Sewing circles are not solely based in trades of cloth, <br/>
There's spinsters all around here taking notes, reporting on us. <br/>

In wake or in slumber, I can't get relief<br/>
From the pictures he paints of the passion in heat<br/>
And though I try, I can't stop listening<br/>
<br/>
And I've tried bribery but to no effect<br/>
'Cause there's no amount of money that would get him to split<br/>
As long as I'm living and we're not together<br/>
I'll be chained to this beast with no chance of severance<br/>

'Cause jealousy rides with me<br/>
Such a faithful companion no one could be<br/>
For a journey that leads to the outskirts of time<br/>
But don't worry about me, I'll be fine<br/>
It beats being lonely, I'll be fine<br/>

As they used to do and they haven't for quite a while<br/>

Because I'm a man who hides from all that binds<br/>
And a mess of fading lines<br/>
And there's a tangled thread inside my head<br/>
With nothing on either end<br/>

I always fall in love with an open door<br/>
With a horizon on an endless sea<br/>
As I look around the ones who were standing right in front of me<br/>
<br/>
And then my mirror speaks with irreverence<br/>
Like a soldier I can't command<br/>
It sees a child in the body of a full-grown man<br/>
<br/>
And he's a man who hides from all that binds<br/>
And a mess of fading lines<br/>

And there's a tangled thread inside his head<br/>
With nothing on either end<br/>
There's nothing on either end<br/>

And nothing changes but the slightest hues<br/>
And I am standing face to face<br/>

Such a pose I could simply not hold <br/>
Through days in a northern town that I had once called a home<br/>
And your studies of fringe New York Streets<br/>
I was reading the pavement in every word you would speak<br/>
To a brownstone up three flights of stairs and it's on<br/>

Buying drinks for the poets upstate<br/>
The southern corruption tows you down the interstate<br/>
And they all said that you were the king <br/>
Of a gloomy disruption that surfaced when you would sing<br/>
And this town simply cannot begin to compete <br/>
So I'm packing my Bullets and Silvertones and heading east <br/>
To a brownstone up three flights of stairs and it's on, on, on, on, it's<br/>

Trust fund hipsters were casing the room <br/>
Chock-full of amphetamines<br/>
The overturned kick drum boom <br/>
Set the pace with incomparable cool<br/>
And if the tempo was lousy it was lost on all but you <br/>

Left a note and it read<br/>
Someday you will be loved<br/>
<br/>
I cannot pretend that I felt any regret<br/>
Cause each broken heart will eventually mend<br/>
As the blood runs red down the needle and thread<br/>
Someday you will be loved<br/>
<br/>
You'll be loved, you'll be loved<br/>
Like you never have known<br/>
And the memories of me will seem more like bad dreams<br/>
Just a series of blurs like I never occurred<br/>
Someday you will be loved<br/>
<br/>
You may feel alone<br/>
When you're falling asleep<br/>
Every time tears roll down your cheek<br/>
But I know your heart belongs<br/>
To someone you've yet to meet<br/>
Someday you will be loved<br/>
<br/>
You'll be loved, you'll be loved<br/>
Like you never have known<br/>
And the memories of me will seem more like bad dreams<br/>
Just a series of blurs like I never occurred<br/>

						Photographs of the best time you had, <br/>
Windows smudged by the speed. <br/>
Leaving home with our bags from Iron Street, <br/>
As morning turned into California, <br/>
And smoke trailed from the butt of my cigarette. <br/>
Our glass house it threw rocks at all those it past. <br/>
<br/>
Waking up to the sound of 5 A.M. to take my turn at the wheel. <br/>
Climbed up Shasta, oh how the engine ached <br/>
As the sun tortured California, <br/>
And old alleys turned deep at the heart of me. <br/>
Murals of heroes defacing the blank concrete.<br/>
<br/>
Vision tunneled, Mission Street, hunger beat <br/>
Lodged out as the engine wheezed. <br/>
Still moving regardless of stable ground <br/>
And this stable ground.<br/>

Photographs of the best time you had, <br/>
Windows smudged by the speed. <br/>
Leaving home with our bags from Iron street <br/>

						I want to live where soul meets body<br/>
And let the sun wrap its arms around me and<br/>
Bathe my skin in water cool and cleansing<br/>
And feel<br/>
Feel what it's like to be new<br/>
<br/>
'Cause in my head there's a Greyhound station<br/>
Where I send my thoughts to far off destinations<br/>
So they may have a chance of finding a place where they're<br/>
Far more suited than here<br/>
<br/>
I cannot guess what we'll discover<br/>
When we turn the dirt with our palms cupped like shovels<br/>
But I know our filthy hands can wash one another's<br/>
And not one speck will remain<br/>
<br/>
I do believe it's true<br/>
That there are roads left in both of our shoes<br/>
But if the silence takes you<br/>
Then I hope it takes me too<br/>
<br/>
So brown eyes I'll hold you near<br/>
'Cause you're the only song I want to hear<br/>
A melody softly soaring through my atmosphere<br/>
<br/>
Where soul meets body<br/>
Where soul meets body<br/>

Increasing the altitude and drove through the hills <br/>

And our battle cry was belated by 6 months <br/>

Or just chemicals that help us understand<br/>
That when our hearts stop ticking<br/>
This is the end<br/>

						We're not the same, dear, as we used to be<br/>

There was little we could say, and even less we could do<br/>
To stop the ice from getting thinner under me and you<br/>

We bury our love in the wintery grave<br/>
A lump in the snow was all that remained<br/>
But we stayed by its side as the days turned to weeks<br/>
And the ice kept getting thinner with every word that we'd speak<br/>
<br/>
And when spring arrived<br/>
We were taken by surprise when the floes under our feet bled into the sea<br/>
And nothing was left for you and me<br/>
<br/>
We're not the same, dear<br/>
And it seems to me<br/>
There's nowhere we can go<br/>
With nothing underneath<br/>
And it saddens me to say<br/>

God damn the black night, with all its foul temptations<br/>
I've become what I always hated when I was with you then<br/>
<br/>
We looked like giants in the back of my grey subcompact<br/>
Fumbling to make contact as the others slept inside<br/>
And together there in a shroud of frost, the mountain air<br/>
Began to pass through every pane of weathered glass<br/>
And I held you closer than anyone would ever get<br/>
<br/>
Remember the J.A.M.C. and reading aloud from magazines<br/>
I don't know about you but I swear on my name they could smell it on me<br/>
But I've never been to good with secrets, oh<br/>
<br/>
Oh together there in a shroud of frost, the mountain air<br/>
Began to pass through every pane of weathered glass<br/>
And I held you closer<br/><br/><br/> </div>"

						And it came to me then<br/>
That every plan<br/>
Is a tiny prayer to father time<br/>
<br/>
As I stared at my shoes<br/>
In the ICU<br/>
That reeked of piss and 409<br/>
<br/>
And I rationed my breaths<br/>
As I said to myself<br/>
That I'd already taken too much today<br/>
<br/>
As each descending peak<br/>
On the LCD<br/>
Took you a little farther away from me<br/>
Away from me<br/>
<br/>
Amongst the vending machines<br/>
And year old magazines<br/>
In a place where we only say goodbye<br/>
<br/>
It sung like a violent wind<br/>
That our memories depend<br/>
On a faulty camera in our minds<br/>
<br/>
And I knew that you were truth<br/>
I would rather lose<br/>
Than to have never lain beside at all<br/>
<br/>
And I looked around<br/>
At all the eyes on the ground<br/>
As the TV entertained itself<br/>
<br/>
'Cause there's no comfort in the waiting room<br/>
Just nervous paces bracing for bad news<br/>
And then the nurse comes round<br/>
And everyone lifts their heads<br/>
But I'm thinking of what Sarah said<br/>
<br/>
That love is watching someone die<br/>
<br/>
So who's gonna watch you die<br/>
So who's gonna watch you die<br/>
So who's gonna watch you die<br/><br/><br/> </div>"

We know not what this darkness brings<br/>
The stars all gleam with possibility<br/>

Creeping even when the population's sleeping.<br/>

Ever current so save your film and $15.<br/>

Billboards reach past the tallest buildings,<br/>
""we are not perfect but we sure try.""<br/>
As UV rays ""degradate"" our youth with time.<br/>

The vessel keeps pumping us through this entropic place in the belly of the<br/>
Beast that is californ-I-A, I drank from a faucet and I kept my receipts for<br/>
When the weigh me on my way out (here nothing is free).<br/>
The greyhounds keep coming dumping locusts into the street until the gutters<br/>
Overflow and Los Angeles thinks, ""I might explode someday soon.""<br/>

Shroud of egos. (is this the city of angeles or demons?)<br/>

Constant cleaning for when the tourists begin salivating.<br/>

You find that all the words of kindness linger on<br/>
When she no longer needs you<br/>

She wakes up, she makes up<br/>
She takes her time and doesn't feel she has to hurry<br/>
She no longer needs you<br/>

And in her eyes you see nothing<br/>
No sign of love behind the tears<br/>
Cried for no one<br/>
A love that should have lasted years!<br/>

You want her, you need her<br/>
And yet you don't believe her when she says her love is dead<br/>
You think she needs you<br/>

And in her eyes you see nothing<br/>
No sign of love behind the tears<br/>
Cried for no one<br/>
A love that should have lasted years!<br/>

You stay home, she goes out<br/>
She says that long ago she knew someone but now he's gone<br/>
She doesn't need him<br/>

Your day breaks, your mind aches<br/>
There will be times when all the things she said will fill your head<br/>
You won't forget her<br/>

And soon Miss Fanny Bright, was seated by my side <br/>
The horse was lean and lank, misfortune seemed his lot <br/>
He got into a drifted bank and we got upsot <br/>
<br/>
[Chorus:]<br/>

A day or two ago, the story I must tell <br/>
I went out on the snow, and on my back I fell<br/>
A gent was riding by, in a one-horse open sleigh <br/>
He laughed as there I sprawling lie but quickly drove away <br/>
<br/>
[Chorus:]<br/>
<br/>
Now the ground is white, go it while you're young <br/>
Take the girls tonight, and sing this sleighing song<br/>

Hitch him to an open sleigh and crack! you'll take the lead <br/>

There stand a country cabin<br/>
Made of clay and wood<br/>
Where lives a young country boy<br/>
Named Johnny B. Goode<br/>

To read or write a book so well<br/>
But he could play his guitar<br/>
Just like a-ringing a bell<br/>

In a gunny sack<br/>
Sit beneath the trees<br/>
By the railroad track<br/>
Oh sitting and a-playing<br/>
In the shade<br/>
Drumming to the rhythm<br/>
That the drivers made<br/>
People passing by<br/>
Used to stop and say<br/>
My oh my<br/>
That country boy can play<br/>

Go go, go Johnny go go go!<br/>

Someday you will be a man<br/>
And you will be the leader<br/>
Of a big old band<br/>
Many people coming<br/>
From miles around<br/>
To hear you play your music<br/>
Till the sun goes down<br/>
Maybe some day<br/>
Your name will be in light<br/>
Saying Johnny B. Goode tonight!<br/>

Rocky Raccoon checked into his room<br/>
Only to find Gideon's Bible<br/>
Rocky had come, equipped with a gun<br/>
To shoot off the legs of his rival<br/>
His rival it seems, had broken his dreams<br/>
By stealing the girl of his fancy<br/>
Her name was Magill, and she called herself Lil<br/>
But everyone knew her as Nancy<br/>
Now she and her man, who called himself Dan<br/>
Were in the next room at the hoe down<br/>
Rocky burst in, and grinning a grin<br/>
He said, ""Danny boy, this is a showdown""<br/>
But Daniel was hot, he drew first and shot<br/>
And Rocky collapsed in the corner<br/>
<br/>
Now the doctor came in, stinking of gin<br/>
And proceeded to lie on the table<br/>
He said, ""Rocky, you met your match""<br/>
And Rocky said, ""Doc, it's only a scratch<br/>
And I'll be better, I'll be better, Doc, as soon as I am able""<br/>

Leaving the note that she hoped would say more<br/>

Clutching her handkerchief<br/>
Quietly turning the backdoor key<br/>
Stepping outside, she is free<br/>

Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown<br/>
Picks up the letter that's lying there<br/>
Standing alone at the top of the stairs<br/>
She breaks down and cries to her husband<br/>
""Daddy, our baby's gone.<br/>
""Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly?<br/>
How could she do this to me?""<br/>

Waiting to keep the appointment she made<br/>

Eating chocolate cake in a bag<br/>

Caught the early plane back to London<br/>
Fifty acorns tied in a sack<br/>

Said we wish you success<br/>

A fallen tree that witness me<br/>

A life lived much too fast to hold onto<br/>
How am I losing you?<br/>

Another dry month waiting for the rain<br/>
And I had been resisting this decay<br/>

Crawl towards a life of fragile lines<br/>
And wasted time<br/>

Careful hands<br/>
And wandering without that much to say<br/>
Your words are empty as the bed we made<br/>
Is there another way?<br/>
Oh love, is there another way?<br/>

The days were short and the father was gone<br/>
There was no one in the town and no one in the field<br/>
This dusty barren land had given all it could yield<br/>
<br/>
I've been kicked off my land at the age of sixteen<br/>
And I have no idea where else my heart could have been<br/>
I placed all my trust at the foot of this hill<br/>
And now I am sure my heart can never be still<br/>
So collect your courage and collect your horse<br/>
And pray you never feel this same kind of remorse<br/>
<br/>
Seal my heart and break my pride<br/>
I've nowhere to stand and now nowhere to hide<br/>
Align my heart, my body, my mind<br/>
To face what I've done and do my time<br/>
<br/>
Well you are my accuser, now look in my face<br/>
Your oppression reeks of your greed and disgrace<br/>
So one man has and another has not<br/>
How can you love what it is you have got<br/>
When you took it all from the weak hands of the poor?<br/>
Liars and thieves you know not what is in store<br/>
<br/>
There will come a time I will look in your eye<br/>
You will pray to the God that you always denied<br/>
Then I'll go out back and I'll get my gun<br/>
I'll say, ""You haven't met me, I am the only son""<br/>

Waiting for the rain<br/>

On the edge again<br/>

Couldn't help but note the coldest thing<br/>

Why do you always speak when you have no grace<br/>
In your precious face<br/>

But even in the dark I saw you were the only one alone<br/>
But these hot gates you spent your victory on<br/>
Though your swore you wouldn't do this anymore<br/>
And I can't be for you all of the things you want me to<br/>
But I will love you constantly<br/>
There's precious little else to me<br/>
And though we cry, we must stay alive<br/>
<br/>
Another fragile edge, and a tender sound<br/>
And then you went aground<br/>
Near a duller blade, a promise out of sight<br/>
There's nothing here for you tonight<br/>

And I'll be a whisper on the wind<br/>

would you weigh light in my arms?<br/>

and I went to Dublin to look for you, Suze<br/>

another misadventure by my misguided feet<br/>
I just sat and I hummed this tune as my toes tapped the beat<br/>

						I am just a poor boy<br/>
Though my story's seldom told<br/>
I have squandered my resistance <br/>
For a pocket full of mumbles<br/>
Such are promises<br/>
All lies and jests<br/>
Still a man hears what he wants to hear<br/>
And disregards the rest<br/>
<br/>
When I left my home and my family<br/>
I was no more than a boy<br/>
In the company of strangers<br/>
In the quiet of the railway station<br/>
Running scared<br/>
Laying low, seeking out the poorer quarters<br/>
Where the ragged people go<br/>
Looking for the places<br/>
Only they would know<br/>
<br/>
Lie la lie, lie la la la lie lie<br/>
Lie la lie, lie la la la la lie la la lie<br/>
<br/>
Asking only workman's wages<br/>
I come looking for a job<br/>
But I get no offers<br/>
Just a come-on from the whores on Seventh Avenue<br/>
I do declare there were times when I was so lonesome<br/>
I took some comfort there<br/>
<br/>
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes<br/>
And wishing I was gone going home<br/>
Where the New York City winters<br/>
Aren't bleeding me<br/>
Leading me<br/>
Going home<br/>

La la la la<br/>

In the clearing stands a boxer<br/>
And a fighter by his trade<br/>
And he carries the reminder<br/>
Of every glove that laid him down<br/>
Or cut him till he cried out<br/>
In his anger and his shame<br/>
I am leaving, I am leaving<br/>
But the fighter still remains<br/>
<br/>
Lie la lie, lie la la la lie lie<br/>

The sun, it rises slowly as you walk<br/>
Away from all the fears<br/>
And all the faults you've left behind<br/>
<br/>
The harvest left no food for you to eat<br/>
You cannibal, you meat-eater, you see<br/>
But I have seen the same<br/>
I know the shame in your defeat<br/>
<br/>
But I will hold on hope<br/>
And I won't let you choke<br/>
On the noose around your neck<br/>

And I'll find strength in pain<br/>
And I will change my ways<br/>
I'll know my name as it's called again<br/>
<br/>
'Cause I have other things to fill my time<br/>
You take what is yours and I'll take mine<br/>
Now let me at the truth<br/>
Which will refresh my broken mind<br/>
<br/>
So tie me to a post and block my ears<br/>
I can see widows and orphans through my tears<br/>
I know my call despite my faults<br/>
And despite my growing fears<br/>

But I will hold on hope<br/>

On the noose around your neck<br/>

So come out of your cave walking on your hands<br/>
And see the world hanging upside down<br/>
You can understand dependence<br/>
When you know the maker's hand<br/>
<br/>
So make your siren's call<br/>
And sing all you want<br/>
I will not hear what you have to say<br/>
<br/>
'Cause I need freedom now<br/>
And I need to know how<br/>
To live my life as it's meant to be<br/>
<br/>
And I will hold on hope<br/>
And I won't let you choke<br/>
On the noose around your neck<br/>

I was desperate, I was weak<br/>

In the quiet, in the crowd?<br/>

Than you were cold.<br/>
Triumphant in your mind<br/>
Of the logic that you hold.<br/>

You said no one would ever know<br/>
The love that we had shared.<br/>
As I took my leave to go<br/>
It was clear you didn't care.<br/>

Everything the heart desires<br/>

Try to out do the fight<br/>

Went to play in the road<br/>
I saw you laughing<br/>

At least once before<br/>
But we've been here more<br/>

Rolls down the window<br/>
I've seen it all go<br/>
Comeback around<br/>
I've heard the sound<br/>
<br/>
The tip of your tongue<br/>
The top of your lungs<br/>
Is doing my head in<br/>
I say love<br/>
Don't mean nothing<br/>
Left them something<br/>
Worth fighting for<br/>
It's a beautiful war<br/>

When I hold<br/>
The warmth of your body<br/>
There is nobody<br/>
That I'd rather hold<br/>
Shattered and cold<br/>

The tip of your tongue<br/>
The top of your lungs<br/>
Is making me crazy<br/>

Fallin' and laughin' at the drinks we spilled<br/>
Just one of those nights that I had to share<br/>
She's in a daze, without a care<br/>

So we take it to the street 'cause we're an ornery cuss<br/>
But we're not here to make your children bleed<br/>
We're here to come around with the tumbleweed<br/>
